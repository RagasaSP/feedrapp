<span id="more-3369"></span>



<h2><strong>What is PEA?</strong></h2>



<p>Palmitoylethanolamide (PEA) is a naturally occurring lipid discovered
more than 50 years ago, when it was first isolated from soy lecithin, egg yolk,
and peanut meal.<sup>1</sup> It is a long-chain N-acylethanolamine (NAE) and analog
of the endocannabinoid anandamide (AEA) that is present in animals and plants.<sup>2-4</sup>
</p>



<h2><strong>History of PEA</strong></h2>



<p>In 1954, published findings asserted that extracts from egg yolk and peanut oil had anti-inflammatory activity.<sup>5</sup> The component in those extracts was identified in 1957 and named palmitoylethanolamide.<sup>5</sup> In the years between 1954 and 1979, researchers found that in addition to its anti-inflammatory properties, PEA also plays a role in immune system activity.<sup>5</sup> </p>



<p>Because of a lack of clarity around PEA’s mechanism of
action, research ground to a halt in the 1980s, then picked up steam again in
the early 1990s when PEA was identified as a mast cell modulator.<sup>5</sup> </p>



<h2><strong>Sources of PEA</strong></h2>



<p>PEA is present in low levels in the human body.<sup>6</sup> The body synthesizes PEA from palmitic acid, the most common fatty acid in animals and a component of many foodstuffs such as soy lecithin, soybean, peanuts, among others.<sup>4</sup> </p>



<h2><strong>PEA’s mechanisms of action</strong></h2>



<p>Investigations have determined that PEA’s pharmacological
effects are achieved through several different mechanisms of action. Several studies
have found that PEA directly activates two different&nbsp;nonclassical
cannabinoid receptors.<sup>7</sup> </p>



<h2><strong>Effect of PEA on the endocannabinoid system</strong></h2>



<p>Initially, PEA was believed to be an agonist of the type 2
cannabinoid receptor (CB2), which is present throughout the immune system.<sup>2,8</sup>
But it has since been discovered that PEA cannot bind to the known cannabinoid
receptors.<sup>2</sup> </p>



<p>However, it is possible that PEA indirectly activates
CB2, as well as the type 1 cannabinoid receptor (CB1) found in the central
nervous system, due to the endocannabinoid system’s “entourage effect.”<sup>3,7-9</sup>
The entourage effect was first proposed as a theory to explain why single
components of botanical substances such as cannabis were not as effective as
the entire botanical.<sup>9 </sup>According to the entourage effect theory, certain
inactive metabolites and closely related molecules significantly increase the
activity of some cannabinoids on the body’s endocannabinoid system (ECS),<sup>9</sup>
which controls and regulates many physiological functions in our bodies.<sup>10</sup>
</p>



<p>One way in which PEA can
indirectly activate CB1 and CB2 receptors is by inhibiting the expression of
fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH), an enzyme that degrades the CB1 agonist AEA.<sup>3,7</sup>
The transient receptor potential vanilloid receptor type 1 (TRPV1) channels,
which are also endocannabinoid targets, can also be indirectly activated by
PEA.<sup>7</sup> From these activities, it can be surmised that PEA needs synergistic
actions among several mechanisms for it to be able to produce its effects.<sup>7</sup></p>



<h2><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2>



<p>As mentioned earlier, the beneficial
properties of PEA have been recognized since the 1950s. Clinical trials
conducted since 1970 have demonstrated PEA’s immune-modulating capabilities.<sup>4</sup>
</p>



<p>PEA is involved in a number of metabolic functions in the body, as well as in maintaining a balance of factors that keep cells healthy.<sup>4</sup></p>

<span id="more-2186"></span>



<p>In some circles “carbs” has become a dirty word, something to be avoided at all costs. Carbs, or carbohydrates, are macronutrients that provide 4 calories per gram and have long been a part of the human diet.<sup>1,2,3&nbsp;</sup>However, following certain emerging dietary trends, such as keto and Paleo, requires removing a majority of carbohydrates from the diet. Whether you “love ’em”or “leave ’em,” it is important to understand how these macronutrients are listed on food labels in order to make the choices that best fit into your own lifestyle. </p>



<h3><strong>What are net carbs?</strong></h3>



<p>Not all carbs are processed in the body the same way. Some carbs have a reduced or no caloric value. This is true for fiber. Other carbs are sugar alcohols and are digested in a different way and thus have a different caloric value and affect blood sugar differently from other sugars.<sup>2</sup> With this in mind, some companies selling low-carbohydrate foods have chosen to describe the carbohydrate content with the term “net carbs”—a term not yet officially defined—to describe the quantity of carbohydrate after subtracting fiber and sugar alcohols.<sup>4 </sup>The idea of net carbs is to identify the net impact that carbohydrates have on the body. However, because the concept of “net carbs” is not a term defined, or regulated, by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), this term is not reliable. What is important is to understand the various types of carbohydrates in your diet and how they differ from one another.</p>



<p>Carbs are plentiful in foods such as baked goods, sugary foods, breads, grains, fruits, and starchy vegetables. While it would be beneficial for almost everyone to remove carb-heavy foods like pastries, soda, and candy from their diet, other carbs that come from whole grains, fruits, and vegetables are important to a well-rounded diet. One of the reasons those types of foods are beneficial is that they provide indigestible fiber, which also helps to provide support for intestinal mobility and removal of waste from the body.<sup>5</sup> Additionally, insoluble fiber, such as that found in bran, has essentially no caloric value because it is not digestible. Soluble fiber does get partially absorbed and provides about 2 calories per gram, instead of 4 calories, as found in other carbohydrates.<sup>1 </sup></p>



<p>Indigestible fibers support the healthy functioning of the body. Insoluble fiber helps move waste through the intestine, often referred to as laxation. This helps prevent <a href="https://blog.metagenics.com/post/2018/10/12/common-causes-of-constipation-and-solutions-to-help/">occasional constipation</a>,<sup>5</sup>&nbsp;which may be a problem with a low-carbohydrate lifestyle. On the other hand, soluble fiber swells up after consumption and provides cushioning in the intestine and also helps to bind unwanted components and cholesterol.<sup>6,7</sup> Soluble fiber also may act as a prebiotic, supporting the growth of healthful bacteria in the intestine.<sup>8</sup> The combination of insoluble and soluble fiber are two key components in helping the intestine to be functional.</p>



<h3><strong>Breaking down net carbs</strong></h3>



<p>For those counting carbs, reading labels is a way of life. It’s important to remember that when carbohydrates are listed on a label, they include the starchy and sugary carbs as well as fiber, so look for foods that provide fiber without high levels of sugars and starch. </p>



<p>A new development in food labeling regulations is that the FDA has redefined what specific ingredients can be listed as dietary fiber based on what the FDA has determined can be supported by specific, scientifically substantiated health benefits.<sup>9</sup> While there is the possibility for other fibers to be added in the future, there are now indigestible fibers that would not be identified on the label as fiber if they were not on the FDA’s approved list, which makes the concept of net carbs even more difficult to justify.&nbsp;</p>

<span id="more-3285"></span>



<p>The keto diet is based on the idea that eating a fixed
macronutrient breakdown of mostly healthy fats, high-quality protein in
moderation, and restricted carbohydrates (less than 50 grams per day) provides
your body with the fuel you need to lose body fat without hunger, weakness, and
fatigue.<sup>1</sup> The reduction in carb intake puts your body into a
metabolic state called nutritional ketosis.<sup>2</sup> Thanks to the diet’s
many benefits, its popularity has grown. That growth has spurned new
variations, such as the <a href="https://blog.metagenics.com/post/2019/01/07/clean-vs-dirty-keto/">“dirty keto” diet</a>, while illuminating
potential nutritional deficiencies that must be addressed.</p>



<h2><strong>A closer look at dirty keto</strong></h2>



<p>Dirty
keto follows the same macronutrient breakdown of fats, protein, and carbs as
clean keto, except for one major difference: It doesn’t matter which foods
those macros come from. So instead of choosing good, healthy fats like
wild-caught salmon, grass-fed butter, and avocado, you eat a fast food burger
(without the bun), processed cheese, and pork rinds. Will you lose weight by
following the dirty keto diet? Yes. But there are remarkable health drawbacks
you should be aware of, too—namely, the dirty keto diet is missing vital
micronutrients like vitamins, minerals, and enzymes that are necessary to your
overall health. </p>



<p>Furthermore, processed foods are usually high in sodium,
which can lead to bloating and other GI discomfort.<sup>3</sup> In my clinical practice, I’ve seen patients both regain
the weight they’ve lost and experience more
cravings and less satiety. Dirty keto foods can trigger these cravings and
feelings of food withdrawal, leading to what’s known as the <a href="https://blog.metagenics.com/post/2018/07/30/the-lowdown-on-the-ketogenic-diet-part-2/">keto flu</a>.<sup>5</sup></p>



<h2><strong>Common nutritional deficiencies on the keto diet</strong></h2>



<p>Overall, choosing the clean keto diet is the better route if you want to minimize these undesirable side effects. However, even the clean keto diet may result in vitamin and nutrient deficiencies. Here are some common ones—and some diet based options that are available to support them.</p>



<h3><strong>Magnesium</strong></h3>



<p>Magnesium is an essential mineral that plays a critical role in human biochemistry and general health. Present in all cells of the body, magnesium serves as an enzyme cofactor in more than 300 biochemical reactions, including protein synthesis, muscle and nerve function, blood glucose maintenance, and blood pressure regulation.<sup>5</sup> Magnesium is also necessary for glycolysis, which is the first step in converting carbohydrates into energy—playing a highly important role in the body’s ability to maintain healthy energy levels.<sup>6</sup> In addition, magnesium contributes to the structural bone development and is necessary for the synthesis of DNA, RNA, and glutathione.<sup>6</sup> It also plays a role in the active transport of calcium and potassium ions across cell membranes, critical to nerve impulse conduction, muscle contraction, neurological health, and cardiac function.<sup>6</sup> </p>



<h3><strong>Fiber</strong></h3>



<p><a href="https://blog.metagenics.com/post/2018/10/29/adding-fiber-to-a-ketogenic-diet/">Fiber</a> is paramount to our digestive health. As
a type of carbohydrate, however, fiber is unsurprisingly scant in the diet of
someone on keto. In this case, adding fiber through leafy green vegetables may
be a good idea.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>



<h3><strong>Iron</strong></h3>



<p>Without iron, our cells cannot get
oxygen. Iron is also responsible for hemoglobin formation and improving blood
quality.<sup>7</sup> Many people struggle to
consume adequate amounts of iron in their standard diets. Iron-rich foods such
as red meat, legumes, quinoa, turkey, and others may help avoid running low on
this key micronutrient.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>



<h3><strong>Zinc</strong></h3>



<p>Zinc is involved in many aspects of cellular metabolism, it supports normal growth and development.<sup>8</sup> Zinc can be found naturally in poultry, fish, and red meat.  </p>



<h3><strong>Electrolytes</strong></h3>



<p>Electrolytes
are substances that are utilized by the body to create electrically charged
fluids. Many bodily functions depend on electrolytes, especially in muscle and
nervous system tissue. Major electrolytes found in the body include sodium,
chloride, potassium, magnesium, calcium, phosphate, and bicarbonate. Some
whole-food options to increase electrolytes are spinach, bananas, prunes,
broccoli, and oranges.</p>



<h3><strong>Thiamin and folate</strong></h3>



<p>B vitamins—such as thiamin, folate, and a
number of others—are indispensable for the body’s energy supply and for the
optimal functioning of the muscles and nervous system.<sup>9</sup> This group of water-soluble vitamins also stimulates the production of
neurotransmitters.<sup>9</sup> When you consume a low-carb
diet such as keto, you might experience a deficiency in thiamin and
folate.<sup>9</sup> </p>



<h3><strong>Vitamin C</strong></h3>



<p>Vitamin C promotes proper functioning of
neurotransmitters and protects our cells from damage.<sup>10</sup> Vitamin C is also needed for building connective&nbsp;tissue and
promoting resistance to infection.<sup>10 </sup>A variety of low-carb foods contain vitamin C, including kale, bell
peppers, broccoli, Brussels sprouts, as well as most fruits.&nbsp; </p>



<p>Compared to the <a href="https://blog.metagenics.com/post/2017/07/14/is-the-standard-american-diet-more-sad-than-we-realize/">Standard American Diet</a>, the keto diet is
not only safe for helping overweight people lose weight, recent studies have
also demonstrated a variety of health benefits that don’t include just weight
loss.<sup>11,12</sup> However,
followers of the keto diet should be prepared to address possible vitamin and
nutrient deficiencies—namely, deficiencies in magnesium, fiber, iron, zinc,
electrolytes, thiamin, folate, and vitamin C. To maintain healthy levels of
these vital nutrients, consult your Functional Medicine practitioner to
ascertain the appropriate dietary changes that suit your individual health
needs.</p>

<span id="more-3226"></span>



<p>Whether the <a href="https://blog.metagenics.com/post/2018/07/30/the-lowdown-on-the-ketogenic-diet-part-2/">ketogenic diet</a> is suitable or not for females has stirred up
some controversy. Women are in a constant balancing act with nature; as far as
biology is concerned, one of the primary functions of the female body lies in
its ability to reproduce and to support another life. The female reproductive
process is very energy-intensive and often makes women particularly sensitive
to any sudden dietary or
lifestyle changes.<sup>1</sup> The ketogenic diet could potentially fall under either,
or both, of these categories and therefore warrants some discussion. </p>



<p>If we take a look into our evolutionary past, humans did not always have access to the abundance of carbohydrates that surround us today, yet our species survived. We are here today, in part, <em>because</em> of ketosis. Ketones were the back-up fuel to get us through periods of food scarcity, ensuring our brain would receive adequate fuel without having to tear down our muscles in the search for glucose.<sup>2</sup> Ketosis is a natural state for humans—regardless of gender—and one could argue that never experiencing ketosis over a lifetime is quite rare.<sup>3</sup> The ketogenic diet is safe and effective, but some women may experience some challenges along the way.</p>



<p>A common concern regarding
women and a ketogenic diet is that ketosis mimics the metabolic state of starvation.
It is also crucial to understand that there is a difference between eating a
diet to achieve <em>nutritional ketosis</em> versus eating too little and instead
entering <em>starvation ketosis.</em><sup>3</sup>
The solution is to recognize that context (and calories) matter. </p>



<h2><strong>Challenges women face on a ketogenic diet </strong></h2>



<p>Ketosis is known to
suppress appetite and can lead to inadvertent calorie restriction. This could
threaten the normal reproductive system. Calorie restriction may be
problematic for some females during their developmental years,
those who are at a healthy weight to begin with, or those who are pregnant
or breastfeeding, or in female <a href="https://blog.metagenics.com/post/2018/08/27/the-lowdown-on-the-ketogenic-diet-part-3/">athletes</a>.<sup>4-9</sup> Unfortunately, the ketogenic diet often gets associated with the
undesirable effects of chronic, and unhealthy, caloric restriction, despite this
diet specifically cautioning against this.</p>



<p>Rapid and significant
weight loss, and just being underweight in general, has been shown to cause
irregular periods or even a complete cessation of menstruation.<sup>6</sup>
This is a telltale sign that your body has sensed something wrong and could be signaling
that you are not eating enough. In regard to reproductive health, the <em>rate</em>
of weight loss could be more detrimental than the <em>total</em> amount of weight
reduction, further supporting the rationale for moderate, versus severe,
calorie restriction.<sup>6</sup> </p>



<h2><strong>Pregnancy and breastfeeding </strong></h2>



<p>Pregnancy and
breastfeeding require appropriate nutrition and caloric intake to support a
healthy outcome. Normal pregnancy often results in a temporary state of insulin
resistance, making pregnant and lactating women more susceptible to ketosis.<sup>7</sup>
Even just skipping breakfast has been shown to raise ketone levels threefold in
pregnant women.<sup>8</sup> If you are achieving ketosis during pregnancy or
lactation, you run the risk of ketoacidosis or “runaway ketones,” which can be dangerous
to the mother and for fetal development<sup>8</sup>. A small set of case
reports have shown that ketoacidosis during pregnancy and breast feeding may be
dangerous and result in serious adverse outcomes.<sup>7,10</sup> Think of it
this way: Glucose is essential, but too much is dangerous; the same applies for
ketones. It is best to discuss any dietary changes, such as following a
ketogenic diet, with your healthcare practitioner—especially during pregnancy
and breastfeeding.&nbsp; </p>



<h2><strong>Cravings</strong></h2>



<p>The cravings for
chocolate, <a href="https://blog.metagenics.com/post/2018/09/17/satisfy-your-sweet-tooth-with-keto-friendly-desserts/">sweets</a>, and carbohydrates around a woman’s time of
the month are real.<sup>11</sup> But who says you can’t feed those cravings on
keto? <a href="https://blog.metagenics.com/post/2018/09/24/10-keto-recipes-to-satisfy-your-cravings/">There are delicious, keto-friendly
versions of your favorite foods</a>. Severely restricting the foods you enjoy often has the potential to lead to binge eating, so keep things real—just make it keto.<sup>12</sup> Keep in mind that just because these foods are keto-friendly doesn’t give you free rein to consume them excessively. </p>



<p>When followed in a
healthy, well-informed manner, ketogenic diet is an amazing and <em>safe </em>tool for women and men alike. The
problems that could occur with a ketogenic diet in women appear to revolve
around total energy intake, rather than the ketogenic diet or ketones
themselves. Women are more vulnerable to changes in energy status due to some
females’ goals to be prepared for reproduction. If you are an athlete, are
young and still growing, and/or are underweight, the ketogenic diet needs to be
properly administered and monitored to make sure you are optimally supporting
your body’s various physiological functions. If you are pregnant and/or
breastfeeding, the ketogenic diet and fasting may not be an appropriate option
during those life stages. And finally, don’t deprive yourself of enjoying your
favorite foods, just find low- or nonglycemic substitutes to keep it keto. </p>



<p>As always,
don’t forget to discuss any dietary changes with your healthcare practitioner
first!</p>

<p>Women
officially enter menopause when a full year has passed since their last period.<sup>1</sup>
</p>



<p>But <a href="https://blog.metagenics.com/post/2018/04/30/making-menopause-your-friend-a-key-to-profound-wellness/">perimenopause</a>, or the time leading up to menopause, is equally significant
in women’s lives. In fact, it’s crucial to a comfortable transition into
menopause.<sup>1</sup></p>



<p>Perimenopause
is also a good time to start practicing <a href="https://blog.metagenics.com/post/2018/03/21/the-benefits-of-yoga-seven-powerful-reasons-to-begin-practicing-yoga-today/">yoga</a>. Many women over 50 enjoy the relief yoga brings to several
of their menopausal symptoms.<sup>2</sup><sup></sup></p>



<h2><strong>What are the symptoms of
menopause?</strong><strong></strong></h2>



<p>Women
today spend a third of their lives in the time period after menopause.<sup>3</sup>
As such, researchers are spending more time than ever exploring remedies to common
symptoms of this condition.<sup>3</sup><sup></sup></p>



<p>The <a href="https://blog.metagenics.com/post/2019/03/15/i-think-im-in-menopause-now-what/">symptoms of menopause</a> may be physically and emotionally
destabilizing. They typically include:<sup>3,4</sup></p>



<ul><li>Aches and pains</li><li>Bloating</li><li>Fatigue</li><li>Headaches</li><li>Hot flashes</li><li>Insomnia</li><li>Irritability</li><li>Night sweats</li><li><a href="https://blog.metagenics.com/post/2019/02/13/sexual-side-effects-of-aging/">Sexual issues</a></li><li>Weight gain</li></ul>



<p>The
symptoms of menopause may vary in duration and severity.<sup>3</sup> They are
generally linked to declining levels of estrogen, and other hormones, that
signal the onset of perimenopause and menopause.<sup>3</sup></p>



<p>A
popular strategy for treating these symptoms is often hormone replacement
therapy (HRT).<sup>3</sup> However, HRT has been linked to an increased risk for
certain health conditions.<sup>3</sup> </p>



<p>Given
the potential side effects of HRT, healthcare practitioners have begun searching
for alternative ways to help better support the transition through menopause.<sup>3</sup>
The latest nonhormonal recommendations include the following:<sup>3</sup></p>



<ul><li>Lifestyle changes</li><li>A healthy diet</li><li>Regular exercise</li><li>Therapeutic activities including massage and yoga</li></ul>



<p>This
article will focus specifically on yoga, including describing ways it can
alleviate certain menopausal symptoms.</p>



<h2><strong>How can yoga provide relief
during menopause?</strong><strong></strong></h2>



<p>While
there’s no cure-all for each and every symptom of menopause, research has shown
practicing yoga consistently may provide ample relief for several symptoms.<sup>2,3</sup></p>



<p>Here
are seven reasons to practice yoga during perimenopause and menopause:<sup>2,3,5</sup><sup></sup></p>



<h3>1. <strong>Unlike HRT, it’s a natural remedy.</strong></h3>



<p>A
consistently regular yoga practice will help quiet the mind and body and may help
reduce the discomfort commonly associated with perimenopause and menopause.<sup>2,3</sup><sup></sup></p>



<p>Rather
than relying on a hormonal approach to menopausal management, yoga is a natural,
comprehensive remedy. </p>



<h3>2. <strong>Yoga relieves stress.</strong></h3>



<p>A key
component of yoga is <em>pranayama</em>, or the
Sanskrit word for “controlled breathing.” This breathwork may help lessen
anxiety, quiet the mind, and help women achieve a calm mental state during yoga
<em>and</em> outside its practice. Pranayama can
even improve sleep quality.<sup>6</sup></p>



<p>Similarly,
yoga can also help women better manage and support overall mood.<sup>6</sup> <em>Savasana, </em>or corpse pose, is a great way
to reduce long-term stress and focus on the present moment.<sup>6</sup></p>



<h3>3. <strong>A consistent practice may reduce blood pressure.</strong></h3>



<p>Some research shows blood pressure may increase after menopause due in great part to the hormonal changes that take place in the body.<sup>2</sup> Fortunately, yoga is a traditionally utilized antidote. A consistent practice may help promote better oxygenation and blood circulation throughout the body.<sup>2</sup></p>



<h3>4. <strong>Yoga promotes good joint health.</strong></h3>



<p>Research
shows a frequent, and consistent, yoga practice may help relieve joint pain.<sup>2,3</sup>
Not all menopausal women have arthritis, but the condition does increase with age.<sup>2</sup>
As such, yoga will help to improve the way menopausal women live and work by
strengthening joints and increasing flexibility.<sup>2,3</sup><sup></sup></p>



<p>Yoga
can also target other common symptoms of perimenopause such as fatigue, making women
who consistently practice it feel more energized as a result.<sup>2,3</sup> </p>



<h3>5. <strong>Yoga may help lead to fewer hot flashes.</strong></h3>



<p>Some
say hot flashes are linked to an excess of <em>pitta</em>
(or “fire”) in the body that must be released.<sup>2</sup> Yoga is considered
an effective way to release that fire, or energy—and slow, rhythmic,
weight-bearing movements may help.<sup>2</sup><sup></sup></p>



<p>Variations
on the lotus pose are well-suited to combating hot flashes that many perimenopausal
and menopausal women report.<sup>2</sup> <em>Asanas</em>,
or postures, including <em>Ardha Baddha Padma
Paschimottanasana, </em>or Seated Half-Bound Lotus Pose, and <em>Supta Padmasana, </em>or Reclined Lotus Pose,
are specifically recommended.<sup>2</sup> </p>



<h3>6. <strong>Yogis may experience relief from physical pain and discomfort.</strong></h3>



<p>Those
who practice yoga regularly have been shown to develop an increased tolerance
for pain over time.<sup>2,3</sup> The specific aches and pains linked to
menopause—think neck and back pain, as well as joint pain and overall chronic
pain—may benefit from utilizing a natural option such as the regular and
consistent practice of yoga.<sup>2,3</sup></p>



<p>To
kick off your yoga practice, consider completing 5 to 10 rounds of <em>Surya Namaskar, </em>or Sun Salutations. Here
are the steps involved in the series:</p>



<h3><strong>Sun Salutation series</strong><strong></strong></h3>



<ul><li>Start by standing. Then inhale while lifting your arms overhead.</li><li>Exhale and swan-dive into a forward bend.</li><li>Jump or walk your feet back into a plank position. Hold this position for five breaths.</li><li>Gently drop your knees down and lower your body to the mat.</li><li>Extend your legs, place the tops of your feet to the mat, and position your hands directly beneath your shoulders.</li><li>Inhale to lift the arms partway (or all the way) into <em>Urdhva Mukha Svanasana, </em>or Upward-Facing Dog. </li><li>Exhale to drop back down before pushing up into <em>Adho Mukha Svanasana</em>, or Downward-Facing Dog. Hold this position for five breaths.</li><li>Exhale as you jump or walk your feet to the top of the mat. Come to a standing posture in a forward bend.</li><li>Inhale and lift your arms overhead, and while exhaling, lower them back down to the sides of your body.</li><li>Repeat the series as desired.</li></ul>



<p>If you
are new to yoga, a beginner’s flow class (or a short video) can help you get
acquainted with the Sun Salutation series. The above steps will be muscle memory
in no time.</p>



<h3>7. <strong>Yoga is linked to better </strong><a href="https://blog.metagenics.com/post/2018/06/06/weight-a-minute-menopause-weight-gain-and-you/">weight management</a><strong>.</strong></h3>



<p>The
hormonal changes associated with menopause may also lead to weight gain.<sup>5</sup>
Yoga, however, is a great way to counter this. Aim to practice at least three
times a week, for an hour each time, to help support weight management.<sup>5</sup><sup></sup></p>



<p>To maximize results across the board, yoga can be paired with other <a href="https://blog.metagenics.com/post/2017/12/27/consider-using-plant-derived-solutions-to-treat-menopausal-symptoms/">nonhormonal therapies</a>.<sup>2</sup> Aromatherapy has been reported to support detoxification, for instance, while meditation is commonly known to improve mental focus and clarity.<sup>2,3</sup></p>



<h2><strong>What type of yoga should
you do during menopause?</strong><strong></strong></h2>



<p>If you
aren’t sure which form of yoga will best target your menopausal symptoms, talk
to your instructor. Click <a href="https://blog.metagenics.com/post/2019/03/04/benefits-of-the-different-types-of-yoga/">here</a> for more information on the different types of yoga.</p>

healthcare practitioner before starting it. </p>

<span id="more-2500"></span>



<p><em>How much screen time should children and teens be allowed each day?</em></p>



<p>Recently, questions like this
have been weighing on every parent’s mind. At what age should children begin to
use screens? At what age is it appropriate to buy your child a phone? Could the
use of screens increase the risks of behavioral disorders and sleep problems in
children and teens? The list goes on and on. Unfortunately, many of these
questions have no concrete answer as of yet.</p>



<h2><strong>Times are a-changin’</strong></h2>



<p>Screens are all around us, and they
are certainly here to stay. From televisions to smartphones, from tablets to
laptops, there is literally a screen for everything. In 2017, 98% of homes in
the US with young children had a mobile touchscreen device compared to 2011
when only 52% of households had such technology.<sup>1 </sup>Things are
changing, and they’re changing fast!</p>



<p>Consider these stats:<sup>1</sup></p>



<ul><li>In Australia, children under 2
years are reported to have an average weekly screen time of 14.2 hours, while
those between 2-5 years old average 25.9 hours.</li><li>In France, 78% of children were
using a mobile touchscreen device by 14 months of age with 90% using by age 2. </li><li>Across five countries in
Southeast Asia, 66% of children between 3-8 years of age are reportedly using
their parents’ mobile touchscreen device, while 14% of children already own
their own devices.</li><li>In Britain, 21% of children aged
3-4 years of age are reported to own their own devices.</li></ul>



<p>Was your reaction to those numbers a negative or a positive one? Part of the dilemma surrounding age-appropriate screen time is an internal conflict of interest. Due to the demands of modern life, education and tech-focused organizations argue that screen time can be used as an educational advantage and may teach kids to be savvy in an increasingly tech-dependent society. On the other hand, some public health officials and health associations warn that too much tech time may pose a threat to young developing minds—causing them to miss out on real-life experience and lack the invaluable social skills learned through face-to-face interaction. Both sides of the discussion make some valid points.</p>



<h2><strong>What is replaced by screen time?</strong></h2>



<p>Like so many other things in life, a healthy balance is the best solution—but that’s easier said than done. It’s clear that parents have reason to closely monitor their child’s screen time. In fact, children ages 8-10 spend an average of six hours a day in front of a screen, including TV time.<sup>2 </sup>For kids 11-14, this number skyrockets to nine hours a day, with five dedicated to television watching.<sup>2 </sup>And for teens ages 15-18, that number averages out to 7.5 hours a day, with 4.5 in front of a TV. When you stop to think about what else they could be doing, these numbers seem alarmingly high. (<a href="https://blog.metagenics.com/post/2018/12/12/9-ways-to-detox-your-life/">Adults are no exception</a>&nbsp;to this either.)</p>



<p>Some
alternatives to screen time: </p>



<ul><li>Activities supporting mental and
physical wellbeing, such as sports, neighborhood play, exploring, and using
their imagination (either alone or with friends)</li><li>Engaging in social connection
and learning to cultivate face-to-face relationships with peers, including
reading emotional cues and developing empathy as well as problem-solving skills
in group settings</li><li>Learning interconnectedness and managing
responsibilities that come from supporting family and local community networks
through chores, volunteering, and taking part in events </li><li>Getting restful sleep and physical
downtime to restore the brain and body</li><li>Reading books and engaging in other
learning opportunities that don’t involve screens</li><li>Using creative expression (e.g.,
writing, drawing, painting, playing an instrument)</li><li>Participating in mindful,
present, and <a href="https://blog.metagenics.com/post/2019/01/18/eat-the-vitamins-kids-the-parental-approach/">nutritious
eating time</a> with family, so as to <a href="https://blog.metagenics.com/post/2019/01/16/packing-nutritious-school-lunches/">avoid
overindulgence in junk foods</a></li></ul>



<p>All of the above suffer when
screen time overtakes the activities of an unplugged, healthful daily life.</p>



<h2><strong>Just how bad is it?</strong></h2>



<p>Research has indicated that more than one hour a day of screen time is linked to lower psychological wellbeing in kids and teens.<sup>3 </sup>And using tech devices for more than seven hours carries twice the risk, with adverse effects such as increased worry, not finishing tasks, loss of curiosity, inability to maintain self-control, and elevated emotional instability. In some cases, high-risk users, over time, experience chronic anxiety and depression.<sup>3</sup> </p>



<p>But it gets even worse. Spending
more time engrossed in tech devices is also linked to an increased risk of
cardiometabolic diseases and being overweight,<sup>4</sup> as well as poorer
sleep patterns.<sup>5 </sup>Adequate sleep in kids is associated with lower
obesity risk, better psychological wellbeing, improved cognitive functioning,
and lower risk-taking behaviors, so a lack of quality sleep is not something to
take lightly.<sup>6</sup></p>



<p>While it’s clear that screen
dependency can cause unnecessary physiological problems for young people, it’s
an effect that can likely be avoided with careful monitoring.</p>



<h2><strong>What can you do?</strong></h2>



<p>There are a few things you can do to support a healthy amount of screen time for your kids:<br></p>



<ol><li><strong>Be an example. </strong>Making a difference starts with you, the parent. Research shows that parents’ relationship with tech and media is associated with their children’s screen time. The less you engage, the less they will, and vice versa. This is especially important to consider at the dinner table.<sup>7</sup></li></ol>



<ol start="2"><li><strong>Limit screen time and set content boundaries. </strong>Research publications have established some parameters to help parents monitor their kids’ screen time:<sup>8</sup>
<ul>
<li>For children under 2, screen time aside from video chatting with loved ones should be very limited. For parents who want to introduce their kids to tech at this tender age, it’s best to stick to high-quality educational programs. </li>

<li>For children ages 2-5, limit screen time to one hour per day including only high-quality programs. And during that time, it’s best to watch alongside your children to help them understand what they are seeing and apply it to the world around them. </li>

<li>Finally, for kids 6 and older, place consistent limits on the types of media they consume and how much. It’s also important to make sure media does not take the place of adequate sleep, physical activity, and other behaviors essential to health.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<ul style="list-style-type: none;">
<li>Some researchers and practitioners also recommend limiting screen time to two hours/day after age 5, not including educational screen time that is used for school and studying.<sup>9﻿</sup></li></ul>



<ol start="3"><li><strong>Encourage real-life social time
and physical activity. </strong>Certain activities should always be screen-free such as dinnertime,
playtime, quality family time, and of course, bedtime.<sup>10 </sup>Encourage
your kids to hang out with their friends on a regular basis and get some form of
exercise every day. Ideally, children should not engage in any sedentary screen
time before age 5, while they are still learning about and exploring their
physical environment.<sup>10</sup></li></ol>



&nbsp;



<p>In a tech-obsessed world, managing your child’s screen time is a job with conflicting interests. Ultimately, it’s up to you to decide what’s right for your family. Try some of the tips outlined above to help your children develop a healthy relationship with tech as well as their physical environment. Remember: The right balance can make all the difference in your child’s health.</p>

<p><em>By Robert Silverman, DC, DACBN, DCBCN, MS, CCN, CNS, CSCS, CIISN, CKTP, CES, HKC, FAKTR</em></p>



<p>Whether you’re
drowning in year-end analysis at work, perspiring over planning your impending
Big Day, or figuring out that financing your latest side hustle isn’t all
smooth sailing, stress can loom over us for a wide variety of reasons.
Sometimes we can easily get to the root of the issue and squash it; other times
we need coping methods to manage and alleviate that stress. Here are six ways
you can reduce stress and get back to mindful and meaningful living.</p>



<h2><strong>1. Make time to <a href="https://blog.metagenics.com/post/2018/09/26/which-workout-is-right-for-me/">exercise</a> </strong></h2>



<p>We all have busy
schedules, and some days, heading to the gym might be the last priority on your
to-do list. However, vigorous exercise will help get more oxygen into your
brain, release endorphins, alleviate stress and boost creativity. Your workout
doesn’t have to be lengthy to be effective. In fact, even a single bout of
acute exercise can have significant positive effects on people’s mood and
cognitive function.<sup>1</sup> Studies show that adults who spend at least 68
minutes a day doing moderate physical activity have better glucose metabolism,
which signals a healthy brain. Those who exercise also have greater brain
volume in the areas of reasoning and executive functioning.<sup>2</sup> Even
light aerobic exercise on an elliptical machine or stationary bike, or a
20-minute high-intensity interval training (HIIT) workout, positively impacts
cognitive functioning and brain-derived neurotrophic factor.<sup>3</sup></p>



<h2><strong>2. Get <a href="https://blog.metagenics.com/post/2019/03/06/benefits-of-deep-sleep-and-how-to-track-it/">better sleep</a> every night</strong></h2>



<p>A consistent lack of
sleep not only leads to short-term health issues, it’s also been proven to harm
you in the long term. Continued sleep deprivation raises the risk factors for a
number of long-term health problems.<sup>4</sup> Furthermore, insufficient
sleep can also have negative effects on mental health.<sup>5</sup> While all of
these health problems may initially increase your stress levels instead of
lowering them, the fix is easy—get more sleep. How much sleep is considered
sufficient? Sleep experts say we should get seven to nine hours each night.</p>



<p>If you’re having
trouble sleeping, your first consideration should be your mattress. Most of us
know that we should replace a mattress at least every 10 years, but how do you
choose the right one? For starters, a mattress should provide firm but comfortable
support to keep your spine in alignment while sleeping on your side or on your
back. When you lie down, your mattress should give you a sense of floating, not
sinking. Memory foam mattresses are a great choice because they conform to your
body’s shape and eliminate pressure points. Hot sleepers can also choose a
mattress that helps you to “sleep cool” and provides the same feel no matter
the ambient room temperature.</p>



<h2><strong>3. Meditate often</strong><strong></strong></h2>



<p>When we experience stress, our bodies react with an increase in blood pressure and <a href="https://www.webmd.com/webmd/consumer_assets/controlled_content/healthwise/medicaltest/pulse_measurement_medicaltest_hw233473.xml">pulse</a> rate, faster breathing, and increased blood flow to our muscles. These responses occur as a result of the release of the hormones epinephrine (adrenaline) and norepinephrine.<sup>6</sup>&nbsp; In turn, <a href="https://blog.metagenics.com/post/2018/02/27/meditation-tips-for-beginners-five-powerful-reasons-for-starting-a-regular-practice-of-meditation/">meditation</a> can help counteract these biological responses, aiding you in controlling stress, decreasing anxiety, and improving your cardiovascular health. According to research published in the&nbsp;<em>Journal of Psychiatric Practice</em>, meditation and mindfulness—the practice of learning to focus on moment-to-moment experiences with openness and acceptance—can be effective in treating psychiatric symptoms, pain, and stress. Even meditating for as little as 10 minutes per day has proven effective.<sup>7</sup> Need help getting started? There’s a wide variety of apps available to guide you in beginning—and evolving—your meditation practice.</p>



<h2><strong>4.
Practice yoga</strong><strong></strong></h2>



<p>Like meditation, practicing <a href="https://blog.metagenics.com/post/2018/03/21/the-benefits-of-yoga-seven-powerful-reasons-to-begin-practicing-yoga-today/">yoga</a> encourages the use of numerous relaxation techniques, which can make you calmer. Also similar to meditation, the breathing you partake in during yoga can bring your mind to the present moment and help reduce stress. Those who have trouble sitting still to meditate may find yoga a worthy stress-relieving alternative. Aligning your breath with movement, and breaking a sweat in the process, can have positive effects on your mood and cognitive function.</p>



<h2><strong>5.
Get regular massages</strong><strong></strong></h2>



<p>According to a study published in the <em>Journal of
Alternative and Complementary Medicine,</em> regular massages can play a role in
reducing anxiety, eliminating excess stress, and keeping cortisol levels in
control. The study also showed that just one 45–60-minute relaxation massage
lowered subjects’ heart rates by more than 10 beats per minute, lowered blood
pressure, and promoted serotonin levels.<sup>8</sup> </p>



<h2><strong>6.
Practice better time management</strong></h2>



<p>A survey conducted by psychologist Robert Epstein revealed
that 25 percent of our happiness relies on how well we’re able to manage
stress. Researchers polled 3,000 participants across 30 other countries about
stress-management skills. Participants were asked about how happy and
successful they were in their personal and professional lives. Turns out the
stress management technique that worked best was planning; when people fought
stress before it happened, they reduced later onset stress and frustration.<sup>9</sup>
The lesson here? Those who plan ahead tend to feel less stressed.</p>



<p>Taking the time to focus on mindfulness
and self-care can greatly impact overall health, wellbeing, and ability to
manage stress. Proper sleep, regular exercise, intentional breathing, and
planning ahead should all be tools in the modern toolbox. Your startup,
significant other, and/or strategy board are all counting on you to manage your
stress—and, ultimately, your long-term health.</p>

<span id="more-3300"></span>



<p><a href="https://blog.metagenics.com/post/2019/04/03/acute-vs-chronic-inflammation/">Inflammation</a> plays a key role in the immune
system.<sup>1</sup> This physiological process, the inflammatory response, is
the body’s way of protecting itself from infection due to bacteria, viruses, fungi,
and other foreign substances.<sup>2</sup> Inflammation plays a key role in the
body’s natural healing process.<sup>1,2</sup></p>



<p>While
inflammation is natural—it is necessary in many cases—not all inflammatory
responses are created equal.<sup>2 </sup>Sometimes the body might be inflamed
when there are <em>no</em> foreign invaders
the immune system needs to fight.<sup>2</sup></p>



<p>Far too
often, <a href="https://blog.metagenics.com/post/2018/05/30/sugar-how-much-is-too-much/">refined sugar</a> is partly responsible.<sup>1</sup>
So if you have a serious sweet tooth and experience symptoms like redness,
joint or muscle stiffness, fatigue, and loss of appetite, you may have fallen
victim to the sugar-inflammation connection.<sup>1</sup></p>



<h2><strong>How does added sugar cause inflammation?</strong></h2>



<p>Consistently
eating high quantities of refined sugar can cause chronic, low-grade
inflammation.<sup>1</sup> This may lead to serious health issues like
cardiovascular challenges, weight gain, or allergies.<sup>1,2</sup></p>



<p>Specifically,
added sugar promotes the following changes in the body:</p>



<ul><li><strong>Gut lining damage:</strong> Frequently consuming added sugar
may help bacteria and toxins from the gut move into the bloodstream.<sup>1</sup>
Long-term gut lining damage can increase inflammation, so this is something to
be aware of.</li></ul>



<ul><li><strong>Weight gain and related issues:</strong> By consistently eating refined
flours and sugars, you may experience weight gain and increased body fat.<sup>1</sup>
The latter is linked to insulin resistance, which makes it difficult for the
body to regulate the processed sugars once they’re absorbed.<sup>1</sup> Insulin
resistance is also associated with inflammation.<sup>1</sup> </li></ul>



<ul><li><strong>Increased production of harmful compounds:</strong> Compounds called advanced
glycation end products (AGEs) form when fat or protein blend with refined sugar
in the blood.<sup>3</sup> Excessive AGEs can contribute to inflammation.<sup>3</sup></li></ul>



<ul><li><strong>Higher cholesterol:</strong> Low-density lipoprotein (LDL)
cholesterol—the “bad” kind of cholesterol—may rise as your consumption of refined
sugar increases.<sup>1</sup> Data suggests high LDL cholesterol is linked to
higher quantities of C-reactive protein, a marker of inflammation.<sup>1</sup> </li></ul>



<p>While the
government recommends that added sugar and solid fats combined account for no
more than 5% to 15% of one’s total caloric intake, 13% of US adults’ total
calories come from processed sugar.<sup>4</sup> All of the above symptoms are
linked to chronic, low-grade inflammation. That said, it’s worth noting that
added sugar consumption alone is unlikely to cause severe inflammation; often,
there are a number of factors at play.<sup>1</sup> </p>



<h2><a href="https://blog.metagenics.com/post/2017/10/25/3-ways-to-decrease-inflammation/"><strong>How
can you support a healthier inflammation response?</strong></a><strong></strong></h2>



<p>Lifestyle
changes can address some of the symptoms mentioned above.<sup>1</sup> Examples
include: eliminating junk food from your diet, reducing your general stress
levels, and so much more.<sup>1</sup> </p>



<p>Regardless,
you will want to take stock of where you are at and make a conscious effort to
improve your health.<sup>1</sup> Read through the following list to see if
there are areas where you can enhance your lifestyle:<sup>1,5</sup></p>



<ul><li><strong>Limit your intake of processed foods and beverages:</strong> This includes added sugar. Carefully read food labels, be mindful of what you order when you go out to eat, and exclude refined ingredients like white bread from your diet. Be sure to avoid hyper-processed, sugary ingredients like sucrose, glucose, and fructose.<sup>1</sup> One study found that lowering fructose consumption can help treat inflammatory blood markers by almost 30%.<sup>5</sup> </li></ul>



<ul><li><strong>Opt for whole grains, healthy produce, and antioxidant-rich ingredients: </strong>When you shop for food, aim to focus on whole-grain carbohydrates like brown rice, barley, quinoa, and oats. These ingredients are chock-full of fiber, which may help to lower blood sugar and reduce inflammation. Similarly, healthy produce is packed with the antioxidants and vitamins you need to thrive—the same goes for fatty fish, nuts like almonds, and seeds.</li></ul>



<ul><li><strong>Lower your stress levels and engage in frequent exercise: </strong>Chronic <a href="https://blog.metagenics.com/post/2019/03/25/stress-and-immune-health/">stress</a> can make you more susceptible to inflammation.<sup>1</sup> To target your stress, aim to exercise regularly (by getting your heart rate up and also making time for resistance training), meditate, go on walks in nature, or engage in other activities that calm you—such as cooking or taking a hot bath.</li></ul>



<p>Returning to the topic of sugar, there’s no need to <a href="https://blog.metagenics.com/post/2018/06/18/why-sugar-leaves-us-craving-more-and-the-first-step-to-taking-control/">give up
the sweet stuff entirely</a>. You might consider
substituting processed sweets with naturally sweetened alternatives in order to
reduce your inflammatory symptoms.<sup>1</sup> The next section explains how
natural sugars like honey and maple syrup may decrease inflammation.</p>



<h2><strong>Natural sugars and inflammation</strong></h2>



<p>Chances
are you’re familiar with refined sugar and how it differs from the natural alternatives.
Where refined sugar is separated from its source, reconfigured, and then added
as a sweetener, natural sugar occurs—you guessed it—<em>naturally</em> in foods.<sup>1</sup> This means it is sourced directly from
a whole plant source.<sup>1</sup></p>



<p>Whole
foods like fruit and dairy products feature varying amounts of fructose and
lactose—yet they’re also full of fiber, protein, and nutrients, so the body is
equipped to process them efficiently.<sup>1</sup> Natural sugar is not
associated with inflammation.<sup>1</sup> It is absorbed more slowly by the
body, which helps to minimize blood sugar spikes.<sup>1</sup></p>



<p>What does
this mean? The verdict is that consuming natural sugar, within moderation, is
just fine from a health and wellness standpoint.<sup>1</sup> Added sugar, alternatively,
should only be eaten rarely and in limited quantities.<sup>1</sup> Please
contact your doctor if your inflammatory symptoms persist even after
eliminating refined sugar from your diet.</p>

<h4>By Milene Brownlow, PhD</h4>
<p>Also referred to as “gum arabic,” gum acacia is a water-soluble nondigestible carbohydrate derived from the sap of the <em>Acacia Senegal</em> tree, a plant native to parts of Africa, Pakistan, and India. The harvested gum is dried and crushed into a fine powder, rich in complex polysaccharides (carbohydrate with several sugar molecules bound together), highly soluble in water, and primarily indigestible to both humans and animals. Consequently, the ingested acacia is not broken down in the small intestine but fermented by the resident microorganisms in the colon.<sup>1</sup></p>
<p>We all know the importance of a healthy gut. How happy are you with a tummy ache or when plagued by constipation/diarrhea or any other variation of a bothered digestive system? The connection between gut health and mood has been strengthened by findings of how specific bacteria strains can regulate not only body weight and composition<sup>2</sup> but also influence brain health and contribute to neurological applications.<sup>3</sup> Acacia has recently gained the attention of the research and medical communities due to several of its health-promoting benefits, such as:</p>
<h2><strong>1. Metabolic health</strong></h2>
<p>Ingestion of soluble fibers slow digestion and the rate at which nutrients are absorbed into the bloodstream. This could possibly help regulate blood glucose levels following meals. Data have shown that ingestion of 20 g of acacia, when consumed with glucose, resulted in lower blood glucose levels than ingesting glucose alone.<sup>4</sup> A 2010 study investigated the metabolic effects of a drink containing gum acacia and pectin in 21 men with metabolic syndrome. After 5 weeks, subjects consuming the fiber drink displayed improved fasting glucose turnover (the rate of glucose uptake and production) despite the lack of changes in insulin sensitivity or fasting plasma glucose.<sup>5</sup> Researchers explored the mechanism of potential blood glucose regulation in an animal study. Specifically, when mice drank water with gum acacia, the researchers observed reduced protein levels of an intestinal glucose transporter, suggesting reduced intestinal absorption of glucose. This effect was sufficient to prevent glucose-induced increases in body weight and fasting plasma glucose levels in the mice that consumed the gum acacia.<sup>6</sup></p>
<h2><strong>2. Satiety and reduced caloric intake</strong></h2>
<p>Acacia may help digestion by adding bulk and softness to stool, which in turn may promote regular, healthy bowel movements while promoting satiety, as described in a study of 10 overweight subjects who consumed a mixture of dietary fibers (including gum acacia) for four weeks.<sup>7</sup> When healthy volunteers consumed 5 or 10 grams of gum acacia, they decreased energy intake and reported increased feelings of satiety three hours after intake.<sup>8 </sup>In another study, healthy women who consumed 30 grams of gum acacia daily for six weeks experienced a significant reduction in body mass index (0.32 points) and body fat percentage (2.2%) compared to those in the placebo group (pectin).<sup>9</sup></p>
<h2><strong>3. Gut health </strong></h2>
<p>Gum acacia has been studied for its impact on gut health as well. This nutrient has been associated with improved digestive health by increasing both the number of beneficial bacteria and the production of short chain fatty acids (SCFAs) in the gut:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>By acting as a prebiotic and increasing the number of beneficial bacteria: </strong>Prebiotics are defined as substrates that are selectively utilized by host microorganisms conferring a health benefit.<sup>11</sup> A case study performed in 1986 investigated whether the daily addition of 10 grams of gum acacia in a healthy volunteer could lead to changes in the fecal microbiome. After 18 days of consuming gum acacia, the fecal sample from the volunteer had higher numbers of <em>Bacteroides</em> and <em>Bifidobacterium</em> colonies than the starting samples, suggesting adaptation to the dietary intervention and increased fermentation of the ingested gum acacia.<sup>12</sup></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Another study investigated the prebiotic efficacy of gum acacia in 54 healthy adults at several daily doses (5-40 grams) for 4 weeks. Compared with the control group (who took 10 grams of inulin which is a well-known prebiotic), the number of <em>Bifidobacteria</em> and <em>Lactobacilli </em>in stool samples was significantly higher in subjects consuming acacia versus inulin with the optimal dose being around 5-10 grams. The doses tested also resulted in fewer gastrointestinal side effects, such as gas and bloating.<sup>13</sup> Since inulin is a well-known prebiotic and known to cause issues like gas and bloating, the finding that acacia gum performed better in both the aspect of promoting beneficial bacteria in stool while not causing as many side effects suggests that acacia may also be a strong prebiotic.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>By increasing production of short chain fatty acids: </strong>In addition to increasing the number of beneficial bacteria, ingesting prebiotics may result in increased production and release of SCFAs, such as butyrate.<sup>14</sup> <em>In vitro</em> research using bacteria isolated from the human colon demonstrated that human colonic bacteria can rapidly utilize gum acacia.<sup>15</sup></p>
<p>Considering its chemical and physical properties and the benefits reported above (and others under investigation), gum acacia is widely used as an emulsifier and stabilizer by the pharmaceutical and food industries. Because of its neutral taste and high solubility, it can easily be mixed into liquids without thickening it or adding any grittiness to its texture.<em>&nbsp;</em></p>
<p>Earlier this year, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) released an updated guidance stating that gum acacia fails to meet the definition of intrinsic and intact due to its chemical structure and processing and is not, therefore, considered a dietary fiber.<sup>17</sup> Industry partners are currently working with researchers to demonstrate physiological benefits for acacia as a dietary fiber and seeking to provide this additional information to the FDA.<sup>18</sup> Acacia gum may, however, be considered a functional fiber under the Institute of Medicine’s (IOM) definition as a nondigestible carbohydrate isolated or extracted from a natural plant or animal source, or manufactured or synthesized.<sup>19</sup> While the “Is acacia a dietary fiber?” discussion continues, we can recognize that some scientific evidence exists demonstrating that gum acacia may support metabolic and digestive health among other benefits.</p>
