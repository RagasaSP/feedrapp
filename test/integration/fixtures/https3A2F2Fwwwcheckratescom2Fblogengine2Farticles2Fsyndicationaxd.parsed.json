Unfortunately, there are things that people have done when it came to buying that first house that they should not have done.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><img src=\"https://www.checkrates.com/blogengine/articles/image.axd?picture=/iStock-640228626.jpg\" alt=\"Home Buyers\" width=\"400\" height=\"300\" /></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>There are a lot of factors that go into making a sound buying decision when it comes to that very first home. You really want to be sure that you have planned ahead before you jump right into the home buying experience.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>5 Typical Mistakes Made by First-time Homebuyers</strong></p>\r\n<p><strong>Fail to realize that there is more to it than affording a house payment </strong>- One of the biggest mistake first-time home buyers seem to make is that they focus too heavily on the mortgage payment. They fail to take all of the other things into consideration and end up in a situation known as house poor. That is when you buy a house and end up with a mortgage that all you do is afford to make the payment.</p>\r\n<p>You need to take your time and go through everything associated with home ownership and be sure that the mortgage payment will fit in with all of your bills. Then, only make the final decision when you are comfortable in the cost of the home versus your finances. It is always a good idea to take a little extra time when it comes to such a big investment.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Looking for a house before worrying about the mortgage</strong> - If you ask any realtor if you should have a good idea of the mortgage situation before you begin your home search. The overwhelming majority of them will tell you that you should already have talked to some mortgage lenders. This is mainly because you do not want to find out after you find some good homes to choose from and then you discover that you cannot afford the mortgage payment for your new home.</p>\r\n<p>The mortgage lender will be able to help go over with you with what amount of a mortgage that you will be able to handle, based on your personal finances. This will go long way in helping you avoid the surprises that can happen when it comes to first-time home buying.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>Not seeking the help of a real estate agent</strong> - It is hard to believe that anyone would not take advantage of the knowledge and expertise of a local real estate agent when they start looking for their first home. An agent will be able to help you navigate through all of the home listings in order to find homes that are going to be a good fit for you. Without the help of an agent, you will more than likely miss some potentially good homes.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>Putting all of their savings into the down payment </strong>- The down payment on the purchase of a home is the way that the buyer avoids having to pay any mortgage insurance in order to secure the loan. The mistake a first-time home buyer often makes is that they drain their entire savings in order to come up with the down payment that is required for the mortgage on the house they are looking to purchase.</p>\r\n<p>This is definitely not a really good idea, you should always leave enough money in your savings for a good emergency fund. This will help to prevent you from becoming house poor after a short time, especially if some unexpected large expense happens.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>Taking out additional loans before the mortgage closing </strong>- One thing you have to realize when it comes to a mortgage, nothing is definite until you sign the papers on closing day. This is because on the final before closing they take one last look at your credit report to ensure that nothing has changed that could jeopardize your ability to repay the loan.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>If they see that you took out additional lines of credit that could change the numbers that they used to calculate your mortgage. It could end up being a deal breaker and you might end up losing your approval. So, if you are looking at adding additional credit accounts, you would be wise to wait until after closing.</p>",

Bradley Mortgage Capital&nbsp;LLC and certain affiliated companies&nbsp;(collectively, the \"Company\") have made&nbsp;a strategic decision to wind-down their businesses.&nbsp; The Company will cease operations and stop funding new loans starting March 13, 2016.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: small;\"><span style=\"font-family: 'Times','serif';\">The Company is in the process&nbsp;of reaching out to its customers, vendors, employees and other key stakeholders to help&nbsp;them understand what this means to them and the proposed next steps.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: small;\"><span style=\"font-family: 'Times','serif';\">Concurrently to this message, the Company is issuing directives to its employees, reminding them of the Company&rsquo;s Privacy Policy and of their obligation to preserve and protect customer and Company information.</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: small;\"><span style=\"font-family: 'Times','serif';\">The&nbsp;Company will immediately begin an orderly wind-down and secure data and collateral to the best of its ability in order to&nbsp;maximize value for its creditors and other stakeholders while minimizing liabilities and future claims.&nbsp; </span></span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: small;\"><span style=\"font-family: 'Times','serif';\">You should not work or come into the office on Monday, March 14, 2016 or on any other day unless you receive written instructions requesting that you work. &nbsp;Unless otherwise informed, any work time invested on March 14, 2016 or beyond will be unpaid. &nbsp;</span><span style=\"font-family: 'Times','serif'; mso-bidi-font-family: Calibri;\">Wages earned through March 11, 2016, (and commissions earned through March 13, 2016) are being processed for payment. &nbsp;For those employees paid by direct deposit, funds should appear in your account via ACH as early as Tuesday. &nbsp;Employees paid with manual checks should receive those checks by overnight delivery to your home as early as Tuesday.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: small;\"><span style=\"font-family: 'Times','serif';\">While the Company is ceasing operations and winding down, it remains subject to the licensing laws of each state in which it operates and to the requirements of the agencies that regulate its business, including the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.&nbsp; This means that you must continue to comply with your obligations to the Company and its customers in the same manner and to the same extent as if the wind down was not occurring.&nbsp;&nbsp;Your NMLS record will continue to reflect the Company as your employer until changed by you. If our borrowers request that their loan application be transferred another lender, you must obtain the borrower&rsquo;s prior written authorization to do so.</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: small;\"><span style=\"font-family: 'Times','serif';\">In an effort to minimize impact to current loan applicants, the attached Transfer Authorization letter can be sent to your customers who wish to request a transfer of their W.J.

The Company </span><span style=\"font-family: 'Times','serif'; mso-bidi-font-family: Calibri;\">must have signed authorization from a borrower prior to transferring data or personal, non-public information.

Upon receipt, the customer will receive an approval response from an authorized Company party acknowledging the request for transfer. </span></span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: small;\"><span style=\"font-family: 'Times','serif';\">Effective immediately, you must get approval from an officer of the Company to spend, purchase, create a new purchase order, enter into a contract, agree to a sub-contract, charge a credit card transaction or commit the company to any liability in any amount from today until further notice.&nbsp; You must also receive approval from an officer to make any commitments from a consumer or receive any deposits from a borrower. This includes both one-time and recurring expenses, as well as travel and entertainment expenses that you would charge in through the expense reporting process.&nbsp; Please note that if you have received prior budget approval for an expense, you must obtain a new approval before you incur the cost.&nbsp;</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: 'Times','serif'; font-size: 10.5pt;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\">Should&nbsp;you have questions, please direct them to <a href=\"mailto:contact@wjbradley.com\"><span style=\"color: #0000ff;\">contact@wjbradley.com</span></a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;Expect additional communications within 24 hours.</span>&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><img src=\"/blogengine/Articles/image.axd?picture=%2f2016%2f03%2fWJBRADLEY.png\" alt=\"\" /></p>",

Most jumbo loan amounts begin when Fannie and Freddie limit their loans at $417,000. However on California, many counties offer conforming loans up to $625,000. This used to be considered a benefit because Fannie Mae loans offered lower rates than Jumbo loans. This is no longer true and you can find jumbo loans on a 30 year fixed for as .25% lower than the conforming rate.</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0in 0in 10pt;\"><span style=\"font-family: Calibri; font-size: medium;\">It seems that some retail regional lenders are beating the major banks on rate as well. A recent survey by Checkrates.com in the bay area compared the rates of Wells Fargo, Bank of America, Citimortgage, and Chase to a few smaller lenders like Parkside lending consistently beat the major banks by .125% to .25% on many days. </span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0in 0in 10pt;\"><span style=\"font-family: Calibri;\"><span style=\"font-size: medium;\">As Fannie Mae and Freddie continue to increase fees, while the MBS market is continuing to pay generous spreads to the non-conforming loans, we expect the &ldquo;Jumbo rate advantage&rdquo; to continue for years to come. <span style=\"mso-spacerun: yes;\">&nbsp;</span><span style=\"mso-spacerun: yes;\">&nbsp;</span><span style=\"mso-spacerun: yes;\">&nbsp;</span></span></span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0in 0in 10pt;\"><span style=\"font-family: Calibri; font-size: medium;\">&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0in 0in 10pt;\">&nbsp;</p>",
