They&rsquo;re costly to maintain and operate, generate waste that can have a significant impact on local environments and nature, and use global resources to construct and operate. In fact, it has been estimated that the daily operation of buildings accounts for 40% of total energy usage worldwide. Now, enter the world of green building.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\nCommercial green building is on the rise--and keeps growing\n\n<p>Green building is the practice of designing, constructing and operating buildings to maximize occupant health and productivity, use fewer resources, reduce waste and negative environmental impacts, and decrease life cycle costs.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>How big is the movement? It&rsquo;s big. Building owners expect to build more than 60 percent of their projects as green buildings by 2021. Decreased operating costs, short payback periods and asset value increases were strong drivers of green building, but creating healthier indoor environments was also a major motivator.</p>\n\n<p>In addition, a rating system such as LEED allows builders to create a better-performing building. LEED, or Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design, is the most widely used green building rating system in the world. It&rsquo;s a system that&rsquo;s now broadening its focus on construction to include maintenance and the long-term sustainment of energy efficiency.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://solutions.parker.com/HVAC-Trends-WP\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"Download How to Capitalize on HVAC/R Trends to Drive Business Growth white paper\" src=\"https://cdn.app.compendium.com/uploads/user/a862d463-3ea6-443a-9187-e1040e91eb0e/b44b1afd-00b2-4096-87a7-b9a574ad823f/Image/899828c70f4bf54d17f966dd73c40982/parkerdownloadwhitepaper.jpg\" style=\"width: 200px; height: 29px; margin-left: 15px; margin-right: 15px; float: right;\" /></a>Download our white paper, <a href=\"http://solutions.parker.com/HVAC-Trends-WP\" target=\"_blank\">How to Capitalize on HVAC/R Trends to Drive Business Growth</a> and learn what actions contractors and distributors must take now, to capitalize on environmental responsibility trends.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\nThe key to meeting greenhouse gas targets\n\n<p>Lowering a building&rsquo;s initial energy consumption is critical to meeting greenhouse gas targets. On the maintenance side, energy savings alone from properly maintained building systems could be 2 to 5 percent or more. From a greenhouse gas standpoint, consumption is 95 percent of the impact&nbsp;of an air conditioning/heating operation. Properly maintained systems perform much better. Refrigerant leakage is prevented but also prevents consumption.</p>\n\n<p>With LEED recertification programs now focused on upkeep, HVAC and refrigeration system maintenance professionals have an opportunity to play a bigger role with facilities managers and/ or building owners. One way to take advantage of that opportunity is by becoming a GreenSTAR.</p>\n\n<p>The Mechanical Service Contractors of America, or MSCA, created the<a href=\"http://www.mscastar.org/greenstar.php\" target=\"_blank\"> GreenSTAR program </a>in response to the demand for LEED certification in commercial buildings. Taking a &ldquo;whole building&rdquo; approach like LEED, GreenSTAR contractors view buildings as an ecosystem &ndash; people, air, water, equipment, and systems all operating together to maximize environmental quality and return on investment while minimizing resource use.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\nProactive vs. reactive approach to GreenSTAR certification\n\n<p><img alt=\"HVACR Trends in Green Building with GreenStar and LEEDS - MSCA GreenStar logo - Parker Hannifin\" src=\"https://cdn.app.compendium.com/uploads/user/a862d463-3ea6-443a-9187-e1040e91eb0e/b2ef3c7e-e21d-428c-8521-33730bc6d466/Image/522a40fe3f034b54b044761d1466d549/msca_greenstar_logo.jpg\" style=\"width: 430px; height: 159px; margin-left: 15px; margin-right: 15px; float: left;\" />Getting GreenSTAR certified is a tangible way for HVAC industry professionals to demonstrate to clients their credibility and expertise in environmental stewardship.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>GreenSTAR Certification:&nbsp;</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>\n\t<p>Provides an opportunity to stand out from the competition and be an industry leader.&nbsp;</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p>Illustrates commitment to ongoing green building training and education.&nbsp;</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p>Demonstrates proven LEED experience.&nbsp;</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p>Highlights an understanding of equipment upgrade and energy efficiency issues.</p>\n\t</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Clients working with GreenSTAR companies benefit from reduced energy costs, improved air quality and water efficiency, greater employee productivity and satisfaction, and assurance that all federal and local environmental regulations are met.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\nGreen building is penetrating the residential world, and fast!\n\n<p>One major green home change that will impact contractors is the new standard for furnace fan efficiency ratings, effective in July of this year. For residential furnaces, that means an industry-wide transition from PSC (permanent split capacitor) motors to more efficient EC (electrically commutated) motors. The U.S. Department of Energy believes the new standard will save&nbsp;Americans more than $9 billion in home electricity bills through 2030.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\nBusiness opportunities abound for the HVACR industry&nbsp;\n\n<p>Clearly, green building &ndash; both residentially and commercially &ndash; holds sustainability options and numerous&nbsp;opportunities for both HVACR contractors and distributors.</p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"HVACR Trends in Green Building and Obtaining GreenSTAR Certification | How to Capitalize on HVAC/R Trends to Drive Business Growth white paper | Parker Global\" src=\"https://cdn.app.compendium.com/uploads/user/a862d463-3ea6-443a-9187-e1040e91eb0e/b44b1afd-00b2-4096-87a7-b9a574ad823f/Image/2d308c997479bcc71d5d005ff112aa1e/hvac_trends_float_shadow_200x217_blog.jpg\" style=\"width: 170px; height: 184px; margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px; float: right;\" />Download our white paper, <a href=\"http://solutions.parker.com/HVAC-Trends-WP\" target=\"_blank\">How to Capitalize on HVAC/R Trends to Drive Business Growth</a> and learn what actions contractors and distributors must take now, to capitalize on environmental responsibility trends.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Article contributed by the Parker Global&nbsp;Team.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Related, helpful content for you:</strong></p>\n\n<p><span><a href=\"http://blog.parker.com/how-to-use-the-smart-service-tool-kit-for-hvacr-diagnosis\">How to Use the Smart Service Tool Kit for HVACR Diagnosis</a> </span></p>\n\n<p><span><a href=\"http://blog.parker.com/top-5-hvacr-and-hvac-climate-control-technology-blogs-of-2017\">Top 5 HVACR and HVAC Climate Control Technology Blogs of 2017</a> </span></p>\n\n<p><span><a href=\"http://blog.parker.com/hvacr-tech-tip%3A-considering-a-refrigeration-system-retrofit-part-1\">HVACR Tech Tip: Considering a Refrigeration System Retrofit?

Parker Aerospace may not engineer robots to load alien planet samples on rockets and cargo spacecraft for another century. However, this past year Parker was involved in &nbsp;exactly this challenge with FIRST and their annual FIRST Robotics Competition Regional, a science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) challenge for students around the world.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>While the theme for the challenge rotates, this year the competition was organized around a space exploration concept. Parker is one of many sponsor organizations that include Boeing, Collins Aerospace, 3M, LEGO, NASA, Lockheed Martin, Motorola, Disney, and many others who made this season of FIRST Robotics possible.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\nInspiring youth with STEM education\n\n<p><img alt=\"Parker Supports STEM Challenge Mission to an Alien Planet with FIRST Robotics - Team 4201 - Parker Aerospace\" src=\"https://cdn.app.compendium.com/uploads/user/a862d463-3ea6-443a-9187-e1040e91eb0e/bc832350-01fa-407d-89bf-449d37d2cb84/Image/14cab9828582651e4daf33de9532dc0c/team4201_img2.jpg\" style=\"margin: 7px 15px; float: left; width: 250px; height: 180px;\" />Founded in 1989, <a href=\"https://www.firstinspires.org/\" target=\"_blank\">For Inspiration and Recognition of Science and Technology</a> (FIRST) was created to inspire young people&rsquo;s interest and participation in science and technology. This nonprofit organization designs innovative programs that build self-confidence, knowledge, and life skills while motivating young people to pursue education and career opportunities in science, technology, engineering, and math. Also working in a competitive environment, FIRST makes a point to teach Gracious Professionalism&trade; as its ethos for interpersonal conduct.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>FIRST offers different programs to target many age groups:&nbsp;</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><strong>Grades K-4</strong>: FIRST LEGO&reg; League Jr. challenges children to explore a scientific concept, then build a model and create code to move it</li>\n\t<li><strong>Grades 4-8</strong>: FIRST LEGO&reg; League gives students the chance to develop, design, build, and code robots to perform autonomous &ldquo;missions&rdquo; with solutions to a real-world problem</li>\n\t<li><strong>Grades 7-12</strong>: FIRST Tech Challenge organizes teams of up to 15 students to explore STEM through designing, building, programming, and operating robots to play a competition challenge in an alliance format</li>\n\t<li><strong>Grades 9-12</strong>: FIRST Robotics Competition takes the Tech Challenge further with limited time and resources along with larger robots, assigning teams to build and program robots to perform challenging tasks in alliance with other teams</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The organization has more than 530,000 students, 60,000 teams, and 80 countries that participate annually.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n<br />\nDestination: Deep Space\n\n<p><img alt=\"Parker Supports STEM Challenge Mission to an Alien Planet with FIRST Robotics - Robot Loading - Parker Aerospace\" src=\"https://cdn.app.compendium.com/uploads/user/a862d463-3ea6-443a-9187-e1040e91eb0e/bc832350-01fa-407d-89bf-449d37d2cb84/Image/9458fab3fe78abfdda959b9f67fabb78/robot_loading_img3.jpg\" style=\"margin-left: 15px; margin-right: 15px; float: right; width: 250px; height: 167px;\" />For 2019 the theme was space exploration with &ldquo;FIRST Launch&rdquo; with the details of enabling vehicles that work on another. This includes a very detailed set of rules that define parameters for the game, arena, robots, humans, safety, conduct, construction, and more.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>For the high school students participating in the FIRST Robotics Competition (FRC), the competition was named Destination: Deep Space. In this scenario, two competing alliances collect samples on an alien planet. With only 2:30 minutes until liftoff, the alliances must gather as many cargo pods as possible and prepare their spaceships.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>This competition uses robots to load a hatch panel at a loading station depot. Six cargo items (orange balls) can be loaded in each of the depots after the hatch panel is installed. Each team may pre-load one hatch panel and a cargo ball, otherwise, these must be retrieved from stations and assembled or collected. &nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"Parker Supports STEM Challenge Mission to an Alien Planet with FIRST Robotics - Playing field - Parker Aerospace\" src=\"https://cdn.app.compendium.com/uploads/user/a862d463-3ea6-443a-9187-e1040e91eb0e/bc832350-01fa-407d-89bf-449d37d2cb84/Image/10e5d05ec49f4d944cce4adf10bc1359/playingfield_1_img4.jpg\" style=\"width: 640px; height: 232px; margin-left: 20px; margin-right: 20px;\" /></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"Parker Supports STEM Challenge Mission to an Alien Planet with FIRST Robotics - Sandstorm-Teams Driving - Parker Aerospace\" src=\"https://cdn.app.compendium.com/uploads/user/a862d463-3ea6-443a-9187-e1040e91eb0e/bc832350-01fa-407d-89bf-449d37d2cb84/Image/ac9dcf8f6062ba0bf2c0e98601c5bd2e/sandstorm_triple_img5.jpg\" style=\"margin-left: 15px; margin-right: 15px; float: right; width: 250px; height: 418px;\" />At the beginning of each game, an imaginary sandstorm limits driver visibility, so robots independently follow pre-programmed instructions or are operated by human drivers via video feedback from their driver stations. &nbsp;Alliances can score points during this period by:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>Deploying robots from the starting habitat</li>\n\t<li>Preparing rockets and cargo ships with hatch panels</li>\n\t<li>Loading cargo pods into their rockets and cargo ship</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>At T-minus 2:15 the sandstorm clears, and human operators take control of their robots with full visibility. The alliances continue to score points by:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>Preparing rockets and cargo ship with hatch panels</li>\n\t<li>Loading more cargo pods</li>\n\t<li>Returning the robot safely to the alliances habitat</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>To make the competition more challenging, the habitat includes an elevated platform that the robot can climb onto at the end of the match. Various bonus points can be scored while penalty points can also be incurred. At T-minus 0 the rockets liftoff and the round ends. The alliance with the highest score at the end of the match wins.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"Parker Supports STEM Challenge Mission to an Alien Planet with FIRST Robotics - Scoreboard - Parker Aerospace\" src=\"https://cdn.app.compendium.com/uploads/user/a862d463-3ea6-443a-9187-e1040e91eb0e/bc832350-01fa-407d-89bf-449d37d2cb84/Image/922d906f1d5e1311c8fc62dc0bc96f2e/scoreboard_img8.jpg\" style=\"width: 640px; height: 204px; margin-left: 20px; margin-right: 20px;\" /><br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n\nParker Aerospace sponsorship and volunteers\n\n<p><img alt=\"Parker Supports STEM Challenge Mission to an Alien Planet with FIRST Robotics - Troy Workspace - Parker Aerospace\" src=\"https://cdn.app.compendium.com/uploads/user/a862d463-3ea6-443a-9187-e1040e91eb0e/bc832350-01fa-407d-89bf-449d37d2cb84/Image/f2f5752a93809b367f68165f3d370650/troy_workspaceimg9.jpg\" style=\"width: 250px; height: 132px; margin-left: 15px; margin-right: 15px; float: left;\" />As a sponsor organization, Parker Aerospace was matched with one of the teams, <a href=\"https://team3952.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Troy Robotics</a> from Troy High School in Fullerton, California. Parker is a financial sponsor of the team for FIRST Robotics Competition, and also partners with the Troy school to provide a summer internship program for students.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>For the last nine years, Troy students have participated over the course of weeks on a range of hands-on engineering projects with Parker Aerospace&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://parker.com/csd\" target=\"_blank\">Control Systems Division</a> and, this year, with Parker&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://parker.com/cso\" target=\"_blank\">Customer Support Operations</a>. Students have worked on circuit design, coding projects, fixture overhaul, database management, documentation, and software evaluation.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>For the FIRST Robotics Competition Regional held at the Orange County Fair &amp; Event Center, 15 employees volunteered this year from within Parker Aerospace for roles such as robot inspector, judge, or scorekeeper. As experienced professionals donating their time for a good cause, they shared their insight as they interacted with students.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"Parker Supports STEM Challenge Mission to an Alien Planet with FIRST Robotics - Jenny Chung - Parker Aerospace\" src=\"https://cdn.app.compendium.com/uploads/user/a862d463-3ea6-443a-9187-e1040e91eb0e/85748467-a655-46bb-a019-c51dea20dcde/Image/df74b566188d5239cd9c00eca491f1f9/jennychung_award5_250x296.jpg\" style=\"width: 250px; height: 296px; margin-left: 15px; margin-right: 15px; float: right;\" />Parker Aerospace wishes to give special recognition to team member <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/jenny-chung-83767011/\" target=\"_blank\">Jenny Chung</a> for helping to lead Parker&rsquo;s efforts with FIRST.

Given the scope of Parker&rsquo;s manufacturing operations, increasing energy efficiency represents a significant opportunity to reduce environmental impact. Since 2004, Parker has reduced its energy use index, which measures energy consumed per unit of sales, by more than 50%. This included a 1.6% reduction in absolute energy consumption and a 2.3% reduction in carbon emissions in calendar year 2017.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Since 2008, Parker has reported its energy and emissions data to the Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP). In 2018, Parker&rsquo;s Climate Change Score ranked in the top quartile among its diversified industrial peer companies.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\nCompany car policy&nbsp;\n\n<p><strong>Parker Sweden</strong>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"Parker’s Sustainability Report Showcases Global Initiatives to Reduce Waste and Minimize Environmental Impact  - Company Car Policy - Parker \" src=\"https://cdn.app.compendium.com/uploads/user/a862d463-3ea6-443a-9187-e1040e91eb0e/bc832350-01fa-407d-89bf-449d37d2cb84/Image/6f1ea38c36a88bf7e349120b075fbf19/car_300.jpg\" style=\"margin-left: 15px; margin-right: 15px; float: right; width: 300px; height: 150px;\" />The transition from traditional gasoline and diesel to vehicles powered by renewable energy represents a significant opportunity to reduce emissions and protect the environment, and Parker Sweden is helping to lead the charge. A new country-wide company car policy encourages team members to choose hybrid or electric vehicles for business use. With a fleet of 125 company cars and an average annual mileage of approximately 18,640 miles (30,000 kilometers), Parker Sweden estimates the new policy is reducing fuel consumption by 18,492 gallons (70,000 liters), helping to reduce emissions by up to 25% without increasing cost.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\nWaste recycling down under&nbsp;\n\n<p><strong>Parker Australia - Castle Hill, Australia&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"Parker’s Sustainability Report Showcases Global Initiatives to Reduce Waste and Minimize Environmental Impact  - Reduce  environmental footprint- Parker \" src=\"https://cdn.app.compendium.com/uploads/user/a862d463-3ea6-443a-9187-e1040e91eb0e/bc832350-01fa-407d-89bf-449d37d2cb84/Image/7d44c2bbd96ea382bba8588de43cd907/cardboard300.jpg\" style=\"margin-left: 15px; margin-right: 15px; float: left; width: 300px; height: 150px;\" />In evaluating opportunities to reduce their environmental footprint, the division&rsquo;s Supply Chain: Procurement &amp; Warehouse High Performance Team noticed that paper, cardboard and wooden pallet waste was being discarded with regular trash, a realization that gave way to a major recycling project with significant results. By creating processes that enabled the proper disposal of key materials without creating extra work, installing colored and clearly labeled bins and partnering with two local companies that offered no-charge recycling, the plant has increased the amount of paper and cardboard recycled from 9% to 50% in the first year, and reduced waste management costs by nearly $90,000. The team plans to build on its success by adding glass and plastic recycling and supporting the rollout of this initiative at other Parker sites across Australia.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\nWeathering the storm&nbsp;\n\n<p><strong>Pump &amp; Motor Division Europe - Vierzon, France&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"Parker’s Sustainability Report Showcases Global Initiatives to Reduce Waste and Minimize Environmental Impact  - Natural reed beds to purify water - Parker \" src=\"https://cdn.app.compendium.com/uploads/user/a862d463-3ea6-443a-9187-e1040e91eb0e/bc832350-01fa-407d-89bf-449d37d2cb84/Image/175797f9a7a0b206e074332e3f343a84/storm300.jpg\" style=\"width: 300px; height: 150px; margin-left: 15px; margin-right: 15px; float: right;\" />After experiencing two significant storms that brought heavy rain and flooding throughout the region, the division became aware that their existing infrastructure was not fully capable of capturing and diverting large volumes of rainwater, which created a number of potential risks related to safety and production downtime. The facilities team not only installed an updated high capacity drainage system that reduced water recycling costs by nearly $25,000, but used it to redirect falling rain to a new self-contained lagoon outside the facility, complete with natural reed beds to help purify the water.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\nCommitment to recycling&nbsp;\n\n<p><strong>All locations</strong>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"Parker’s Sustainability Report Showcases Global Initiatives to Reduce Waste and Minimize Environmental Impact  - Commitment to recycling- Parker \" src=\"https://cdn.app.compendium.com/uploads/user/a862d463-3ea6-443a-9187-e1040e91eb0e/bc832350-01fa-407d-89bf-449d37d2cb84/Image/fe1759dfaa7c25199b55bee303d1054a/recycling_300.jpg\" style=\"margin-left: 15px; margin-right: 15px; float: left; width: 300px; height: 150px;\" />Parker team members are taking action to conserve resources and help protect the environment. Today Parker recycles more than 85% of the waste generated from its manufacturing operations, and the company continues to make progress toward its goal of reducing water use and the volume of waste sent to landfills by 20% between 2015 and 2020. This year Parker also engaged in several strategic partnerships that will help support environmental initiatives, including the implementation of a fluid management program and ongoing development of a resource tracking and reporting structure.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.parker.com/sustainability\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"Parker’s Sustainability Report Showcases Global Initiatives to Reduce Waste and Minimize Environmental Impact  - 2018 Sustainability Report - Parker\" src=\"https://cdn.app.compendium.com/uploads/user/a862d463-3ea6-443a-9187-e1040e91eb0e/bc832350-01fa-407d-89bf-449d37d2cb84/Image/b9b6ee84dbdc6bfb5ccae5ba0c96cc39/sustainability_report_b_150.jpg\" style=\"margin-left: 15px; margin-right: 15px; float: left; width: 150px; height: 140px;\" />Download the 2018&nbsp;sustainability report to learn more</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Related content</strong></p>\n\n<p><span><a href=\"http://blog.parker.com/parkers-2018-sustainability-report-highlights-commitment-to-social-responsibility\">Parker&rsquo;s 2018 Sustainability Report Highlights Commitment to Social Responsibility </a> </span></p>\n\n<p><span><span><a href=\"http://blog.parker.com/protecting-our-planet\">Protecting Our Planet</a> </span></span></p>\n\n<p><span><span><span><a href=\"http://blog.parker.com/sustainability-report-highlights-team-members-efforts-to-improve-their-workplaces-and-communities\">Sustainability Report Highlights Team Members&rsquo; Efforts to Improve Their Workplaces and Communities </a> </span></span></span></p>\n\n<p><span><span><a href=\"http://blog.parker.com/parkers-sustainability-report-highlights-local-impact-of-global-commitment-to-responsible-operations\">Parker&rsquo;s Sustainability Report Highlights Local Impact of Global Commitment to Responsible Operations</a> </span></span></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n",

But apparently not quickly enough--in May of 2018 renewable energy represented about 15% of the total energy supply. Global sustainability goals, in contrast, have been set for it to represent 65% of the total supply by 2050.</p>\n\n<p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">&quot;Key to the future of renewables is the speed at which innovations can be commercialized and the commitment to continue funding research and development.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\nWhat&rsquo;s holding us back?\n\n<p>It depends on who you ask. Various experts cite an array of causes which include politics, misperceptions, a loss of tax incentives, and an overall lack of innovation. Regardless of the cause, the result is the same&mdash; renewable power plants are not where they need to be from a productivity and profitability perspective. Simply stated, there is not enough power being generated consistently at a low enough cost. And the financial challenge could become more substantial, especially in the US, with a number of federally subsidized programs no longer in place to prop up the emerging technologies.</p>\n\n<p>In the area of wind power, for example, a major policy incentive&mdash;the federal production tax credit&mdash;expires in 2019. Newly built wind plants using production tax credits have proven cost-competitive with new natural gas plants in some parts of the US, especially in the &ldquo;wind belt&rdquo; that runs from Texas to North Dakota. However, new technology breakthroughs will be needed to drop the unsubsidized cost of wind energy below the projected cost of fuel for existing natural gas plants.</p>\n\n<p>In order to succeed, these alternatives must make financial sense. Costs need to come down. And, the sources need to be more reliable.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://solutions.parker.com/renewables-innovations-whitepaper-social\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"Download The Future of Renewable Energy Relies on Innovations Focused on Increasing Output and Decreasing Costs White Paper\" src=\"https://cdn.app.compendium.com/uploads/user/a862d463-3ea6-443a-9187-e1040e91eb0e/b44b1afd-00b2-4096-87a7-b9a574ad823f/Image/899828c70f4bf54d17f966dd73c40982/parkerdownloadwhitepaper.jpg\" style=\"width: 245px; height: 36px; margin-left: 15px; margin-right: 15px; float: right;\" /></a>Download <a href=\"http://solutions.parker.com/renewables-innovations-whitepaper-social\">The Future of Renewable Energy Relies on Innovations Focused on Increasing Output and Decreasing Costs White Paper</a> to discover the various emerging technologies and processes that have been positioned to help increase productivity and profitability in renewable power plants, and the challenges facing the industry as a whole.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\nWhere are we at today?\n\n<p>According to the US Energy Information Administration (EIA), in 2017 about 4.03 trillion kilowatt-hours (kWh) of electricity were generated at utility-scale facilities in the US. About 63% of this electricity generation was from fossil fuels, such as coal, natural gas, petroleum, and other gasses. About 20% was from nuclear energy, and about 17% was from renewable energy sources. Within the renewable energy category, three of the more promising technologies included hydropower at 7.4%, wind power at 6.3%, and solar power at 1.3%.</p>\n\n<p>Globally, clean renewable energy has made better strides. In 2017, the World Economic Forum estimated that a fifth of the world&rsquo;s electricity was produced by renewable energy. Even better was that costs came down. Between 2015 and 2016, not only did the number of renewable energy installations increase by 10% globally but the new plants in 2016 cost almost a quarter less.</p>\n\n<p>The World Economic Forum further noted that, on a global scale, solar power provided the biggest boost, providing half of all new capacity, followed by wind power, which provided a third, and hydropower which gave 15%. 2016 was the first year in history that added solar capacity outstripped any other electricity-producing technology.</p>\n\n<p>Currently, China and India are leading the industry with the steepest capacity installation targets over the next 10-15 years. This is largely due to concerns over excessive levels of pollution in many of their key cities. Despite the US withdrawal, the targets in the Paris Agreement are also still expected to be key drivers for future sector growth.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\nClean energy costs decline while energy storage costs remain high\n\n<p>The big news is that the world has seen an unprecedented drop in the cost of producing clean energy in the last few years. In fact, it is becoming the cheapest source of power for more and more countries. Both solar and wind power have undergone an annual average percentage drop in the cost of production in the mid to high teens. In fact, the global weighted average levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) of utility-scale solar PV fell by 73% between 2010 and 2017. The average cost of electricity from onshore wind fell by 23% during that same time period.</p>\n\n<p>The big challenge, of course, continues to be the identification of viable storage solutions to ensure that electric generation matches electric demand in real-time and, ultimately, achieves grid reliability. Unfortunately, energy storage remains expensive.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\nThe future of wind power\n\n<p>It&rsquo;s projected that new energy science and technological breakthroughs could cut the cost of wind energy in half by 2030, making it fully competitive with the fuel cost of natural gas. This assumes, however, that the US will continue to invest in research and development. The wind plant of the future will use a collection of technologies that allow wind power plants and the turbines within them to not only respond to the atmosphere as an efficient, integrated system but also to control the airflow within the plant to maximize power production.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\nSolar plants have a bright future\n\n<p>The solar photovoltaic (PV) market has been expanding exponentially in recent years largely as a result of the reduction in costs for silicon solar cells. The key to advancing solar power capacity to the next level is to increase the efficiency of the solar cells. Some researchers believe that the answer might not be with silicon, which is the most commonly used material today. The problem with silicon is its inefficiency as silicon cells typically only achieve 16-20% efficiency when it comes to converting energy. Multiple other innovations have focused on increasing the efficiency of the solar panels.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>As is the case with wind power plants, significant costs can be reduced at solar plants through<a href=\"http://blog.parker.com/implementing-an-asset-management-and-maintenance-program-consider-risk\" target=\"_blank\"> <strong>effective maintenance programs</strong></a>.&nbsp;Automatic data acquisition and monitoring technologies prove especially valuable by allowing the plants to be monitored remotely. This is a key consideration since most PV plants are in remote areas. Some industry experts believe that maintenance technologies are the key to the future of profitable, reliable solar power.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://solutions.parker.com/renewables-innovations-whitepaper-social\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"Download The Future of Renewable Energy Relies on Innovations Focused on Increasing Output and Decreasing Costs White Paper\" src=\"https://cdn.app.compendium.com/uploads/user/a862d463-3ea6-443a-9187-e1040e91eb0e/b44b1afd-00b2-4096-87a7-b9a574ad823f/Image/62cc49edcf44cf54af2b8b709e60fd73/wp_cover_future_of_renewables.jpg\" style=\"width: 100px; height: 130px; margin-left: 15px; margin-right: 15px; float: right;\" /></a>Download <a href=\"http://solutions.parker.com/renewables-innovations-whitepaper-social\" target=\"_blank\">The Future of Renewable Energy Relies on Innovations Focused on Increasing Output and Decreasing Costs White Paper</a>&nbsp;to discover the various emerging technologies and processes that have been positioned to help renewable power plants increase their output and decrease costs.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\nAttending the 2019 PowerGen International show?\n\n<p>Visit Booth #3119 at POWERGEN International 2019 to see how Parker offers the most comprehensive product and system solutions for today&rsquo;s power generation environments. <a href=\"http://solutions.parker.com/powergenintl2019\" target=\"_blank\">Learn more about our filtration products, sealing and shielding, sensors and diagnostics, heated enclosure system, combustion turbine and energy storage solutions.</a></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color: rgb(68, 68, 68); font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Article contributed by Parker Energy Team</span></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong><span style=\"color: rgb(68, 68, 68); font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Related, helpful content for you:</span></strong></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color: rgb(68, 68, 68); font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><span><a href=\"http://blog.parker.com/iot-solutions-reduce-time-and-cost-for-solar-panel-inspection\">IoT Solutions Reduce Time and Cost for Solar Panel Inspection</a> </span></span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color: rgb(68, 68, 68); font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><span><a href=\"http://blog.parker.com/why-choose-an-electric-starter-for-your-gas-turbines\">Why Choose an Electric Starter for Your Gas Turbines?</a> </span></span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color: rgb(68, 68, 68); font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><span><span><a href=\"http://blog.parker.com/how-to-provide-power-to-remote-locations-through-differential-pressure\">How to Provide Power to Remote Locations Through Differential Pressure </a> </span></span></span></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://blog.parker.com/how-to-choose-a-water-treatment-system-supplier-for-power-generation\">How to Choose a Water Treatment System Supplier for Power Generation</a></p>\n",
