				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ever wanted a magic wand to tame a tantrum? Thrown your hands up trying to get your child to eat another bite? Or wondered how many more miles &#8217;til they hit the road to dreamland? Whatever your parenting 911, we&#8217;ve got a musical parenting hack for you to try! The great news is you already have the goods to make the magic happen! So, exhale and read on.</p>
<h2 style="color: #fd4f57; margin-top: 1em;">1. It&#8217;s all about Me, ME, MEEEEEE!</h2>
<img class="desktop-only" style="margin-right: 1em; float: left;" title="1. It's all about Me, ME, MEEEEEE!" src="https://www.musictogether.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/JS_blog_20170111_ParentingHacks_1-BabyCenterofAttention_3288805.png" alt="1. It's all about Me, ME, MEEEEEE!" width="150" />
<p>Not only does your child love to hear you sing, they love to hear you sing about THEM. It feels good to be a VIP! When your child hears their name, it&#8217;s brain food for focus and attention. Substituting your child&#8217;s name in &#8220;<em>Mary</em> Had a Little Lamb&#8221; or singing &#8220;This little <em>Lauren</em> of mine&#8221; (instead of <em>&#8220;light&#8221;</em>) can be so powerful in getting or redirecting their attention. Try it!</p>
<div class="mobile-only" style="padding: 0.5em;" align="center"><img title="1. It's all about Me, ME, MEEEEEE!" src="https://www.musictogether.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/JS_blog_20170111_ParentingHacks_1-BabyCenterofAttention_3288805.png" alt="1. It's all about Me, ME, MEEEEEE!" width="300" /></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 style="color: #fd4f57; margin-top: 2em;">2. Take your silly seriously</h2>
<img class="desktop-only" style="margin-right: 1em; float: left;" title="2. Take your silly seriously" src="https://www.musictogether.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/JS_blog_20170111_ParentingHacks_2_VacuumGuitar_270012062.png" alt="2. Take your silly seriously" width="150" align="left" />
<p>Pull out an unexpected silly song or dance during dreary chores or errands and make the day sunny again! Try holding your nose and singing &#8220;Hello, Everybody&#8221; or &#8220;Row, Row, Row Your Boat.&#8221; Sweeping or vacuuming? Take a guitar solo! You&#8217;ll all get the giggles!</p>
<div class="mobile-only" style="padding: 0.5em;" align="center"><img title="2. Take your silly seriously" src="https://www.musictogether.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/JS_blog_20170111_ParentingHacks_2_VacuumGuitar_270012062.png" alt="2. Take your silly seriously" width="350" /></div>
<h2 style="color: #fd4f57; margin-top: 5em;">3. Go! Stop! . . . Go!!!</h2>
<img class="desktop-only" style="margin-right: 1em; float: left;" title="3. Go! Stop! . . . Go!!!" src="https://www.musictogether.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/JS_blog_20170111_ParentingHacks_3_049143323-family-leaving-their-house.png" alt="3. Go! Stop! . . . Go!!!" width="150" align="left" />
<p>Play the freeze game to get your family out the door. <em>&#8220;Toot&#8221;</em> your &#8220;horn&#8221; and march slowly toward the door to &#8220;Marching and Drumming&#8221; (Fiddle Song Collection, in the <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/hello-everybody/id1019486012" target="_blank" rel="noopener">&#8220;Hello Everybody&#8221; app</a> or the <a href="/familymusiczone" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Family Music Zone</a>). Freeze after the first part of the song and give your child a sly look before marching quickly again. By the second time through, your child will want to lead YOU! (P.S. Teachers, this works well in the classroom, too.)</p>
<div class="mobile-only" style="padding: 0.5em;" align="center"><img title="3. Go! Stop! . . . Go!!!" src="https://www.musictogether.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/JS_blog_20170111_ParentingHacks_3_049143323-family-leaving-their-house.png" alt="3. Go! Stop! . . . Go!!!" width="300" /></div>
<h2 style="color: #fd4f57; margin-top: 3em;">4. Beat the clock</h2>
<p><iframe class="desktop-only" style="margin-right: 1em; float: left;" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/hxIuIxqo2So?rel=0" width="200" height="auto" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p>Ask your toddler or preschooler if they can put their socks/pants/hat on before the end of &#8220;A Ram Sam Sam&#8221; (or the &#8220;William Tell Overture&#8221;/&#8221;Lone Ranger&#8221; theme)! Give them a turn to sing while <em>you</em> beat the clock putting on your shoes, too!</p>
<div class="mobile-only" align="center"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/hxIuIxqo2So?rel=0" width="350" height="262.5" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></div>
<h2 style="color: #fd4f57; margin-top: 4em;">5. Party in Aisle 3!</h2>
<img class="desktop-only" style="margin-right: 1em; float: left;" title="5. Party in Aisle 3!" src="https://www.musictogether.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/JS_blog_20170111_ParentingHacks_6-GroceryShopping_65373406.png" alt="5. Party in Aisle 3!" width="150" align="left" />
<p>Fly through your list as you sing the items off the grocery store shelves and let your child toss them in your basket. &#8220;Apples and Cherries&#8221; isn&#8217;t just for singing about fruit!</p>
<div class="mobile-only" style="padding: 0.5em;" align="center"><img title="5. Party in Aisle 3!" src="https://www.musictogether.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/JS_blog_20170111_ParentingHacks_6-GroceryShopping_65373406.png" alt="5. Party in Aisle 3!" width="300" /></div>
<h2 style="color: #fd4f57; margin-top: 6em;">6. Who&#8217;s your baby?</h2>
<img class="desktop-only" style="margin-right: 1em; float: left;" title="6. Who's your baby?" src="https://www.musictogether.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/JS_blog_20170111_ParentingHacks_8-SleepingChildwithStuffedAnimal_2857712.png" alt="7. Who's your baby?" width="150" align="left" />
<p>Imaginative play . . . at bedtime? Yep! Ask your child to choose a &#8220;baby&#8221; (favorite doll or stuffed animal) to sing and rock to sleep as part of bedtime. Once &#8220;baby&#8221; is snug and asleep, repeat the ritual—with your child!</p>
<div class="mobile-only" style="padding: 0.5em;" align="center"><img title="6. Who's your baby?" src="https://www.musictogether.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/JS_blog_20170111_ParentingHacks_8-SleepingChildwithStuffedAnimal_2857712.png" alt="7. Who's your baby?" width="300" /></div>
<h2 style="color: #fd4f57; margin-top: 6em;">7. Turn any song into a lullaby</h2>
<img class="desktop-only" style="margin-right: 1em; float: left;" title="7. Turn any song into a lullaby" src="https://www.musictogether.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/JS_blog_20170111_ParentingHacks_9_ShhBabySleeping_3618433.png" alt="8. Turn any song into a lullaby" width="150" align="left" />
<p>Transform a song you love—even if it&#8217;s not technically a children&#8217;s song—into a lullaby by singing it softly and slowly. Drop the words the second time through, singing <em>&#8220;loo-loo&#8221;</em> or humming it, and watch those little eyes close!</p>
<div class="mobile-only" style="padding: 0.5em;" align="center"><img title="7. Turn any song into a lullaby" src="https://www.musictogether.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/JS_blog_20170111_ParentingHacks_9_ShhBabySleeping_3618433.png" alt="8. Turn any song into a lullaby" width="300" /></div>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="desktop-only" style="float: left;"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1414 alignleft" style="padding: 0em 1em 0em 0em; margin-top: 10;" src="https://www.musictogether.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/mom-walking-kids-small.jpg" alt="mom walking children to school" width="auto" height="225" /></div>
<p style="margin-bottom: 1.25em; font-size: 1.25em; color: #fd4f57; line-height: 135%;">Getting ready to go to preschool can be really exciting—and a little bit scary. Changes in routine often benefit from pre-planning and practice.</p>
<div class="mobile-only" align="center"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1414 alignleft" src="https://www.musictogether.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/mom-walking-kids-small.jpg" alt="mom walking children to school" width="auto" height="200" /></div>
<p><a href="https://www.zerotothree.org/resources/78-preschool-prep-how-to-prepare-your-toddler-for-preschool" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Zero to Three</a> and <a href="https://www.pbs.org/parents/thrive/helping-preschoolers-cope-with-separation-anxiety" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PBS Kids</a> both have great articles on this topic. It&#8217;s likely that your child&#8217;s preschool teacher will use songs and chants to manage the classroom flow from one activity to another. Transition songs are wonderful &#8220;tools&#8221; in a teacher&#8217;s toolbox! Songs and chants convey information that can be repeated many times while retaining excitement and beauty. Singing a song about cleaning up is much more interesting than hearing (or saying!) &#8220;It&#8217;s time to clean up.&#8221;</p>
<h2>Before Preschool Starts</h2>
<p>Songs and chants can decrease the stress of the transition from home to school, too. If your little one is nervous about going to school, singing a few songs about school can encourage excitement about the new things they will experience. You might change the words to a well-known song to include verses about playing with new friends, learning new things, or having a snack or lunch. For instance, you might try singing these verses to the tune of &#8220;She&#8217;ll be Comin&#8217; &#8216;Round the Mountain&#8221;:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px;">I am going to my preschool today,<br />
I am going to my preschool today,<br />
I am going to my preschool,<em> *I&#8217;m gonna play with friends,*</em><br />
I am going to my preschool today!</p>
<p>You can change the words &#8220;I&#8217;m gonna play with friends&#8221; to any number of typical preschool experiences. Try replacing the phrase &#8220;play with friends&#8221; with &#8220;sit in circle,&#8221; &#8220;draw a picture,&#8221; &#8220;learn my letters,&#8221; or even simply &#8220;have a good time.&#8221;</p>
<h2>Reassurances</h2>
<p>Your preschooler may need extra reassurance that you (or someone they love and trust) will return at the end of the day. If you do not already have a song in your family repertoire that addresses this concern, consider the Music Together song &#8220;They Come Back.&#8221; This little tune combines a question-and-answer construction with a bit of humor to help young children articulate their feelings. If you are not a confident singer, consider singing along with the recording. Use exaggerated facial expressions and hugs to help communicate the idea that a reunion is only a few hours away. A free download of the song is available <a href="/they-come-back" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>.</p>
<h2>After School</h2>
<p>The period of time after school is another transition. If your child struggles to transition from school to home, consider using the same song, &#8220;She&#8217;ll Be Comin&#8217; &#8216;Round the Mountain,&#8221; with new words to help your child reflect on the events of the day.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px;">I went to my preschool today,<br />
I went to my preschool today,<br />
I went to my preschool and *<em>we played outside</em>,*<br />
I went to my preschool today!</p>
<p>You can extend this sharing time by asking your child questions about their experience to get more detail: &#8220;What activity center did you choose first?&#8221; &#8220;Who did you play with when you played outside?&#8221; &#8220;Which activity was your favorite today?&#8221; &#8220;What was the most exciting thing that happened today?&#8221; Sing a new verse for each of their answers or just make up silly verses, and enjoy the time you spend with your child.</p>
<h2>Songs Convey Emotion</h2>
<p>The idea behind using songs in this way comes from what we know about music&#8217;s ability to communicate emotions. The melodic contour of a song (the way notes of the song move up and down to create the recognizable tune) and predictable rhythm (the divisions of the song&#8217;s pulse) provide developing brains with the necessary multi-sensory input to organize and process information, including information about emotion.</p>
<p>Some of the factors that influence how a person perceives the emotional component of a song include the following: familiarity with the particular song, familiarity with the singer&#8217;s voice or the rendition of the song, current emotional state, and culture. For a particularly good review of the neuroscience of children&#8217;s development, including how rhythm impacts this in positive ways, please review this talk by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IHFWUVaj4g" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dr. Laurel Trainor</a> given at the Kennedy Center.</p>
<p>There is no single &#8220;right&#8221; song to help your child through transitions, so having a selection at your fingertips can be very helpful! &#8220;She&#8217;ll Be Comin&#8217; &#8216;Round the Mountain,&#8221; may be familiar to some families, but others may be more familiar with &#8220;Hiné Ma Tov&#8221; or &#8220;Obwisana.&#8221; Choose a song that works for your family and make it your own. You will build a new tradition that will serve you through a variety of transitions.</p>
<p>And, don&#8217;t worry about making &#8220;mistakes&#8221;—as you sing, your child hears that you love them.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[“Music…was the first language that my children learned. And because all my children attended Music Together, we all ‘speak’ that same language." <a href="/blog/keene-family-spotlight/">Read more</a>]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="desktop-only" style="float: left;"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1414 alignleft" style="padding: 0em 1em 0em 5em; margin-top: 10;" src="https://www.musictogether.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/SongCollectionsGraphics-Flute-web-e1563207212627.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="388" /></div>
<p style="margin-bottom: 1.25em; font-size: 1.25em; color: #fd4f57; line-height: 135%;">Amidst the picturesque mountains of Zurich, Switzerland, many devoted families attend classes at director Cezanne Winter’s center, Music Together Zurich. However, none are <em>quite</em> so invested as Sara Keene (not her real name), who has continuously attended classes for thirteen years—and counting.</p>
<div class="mobile-only" align="center"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1414 alignleft" src="https://www.musictogether.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/SongCollectionsGraphics-Flute-web-e1563207212627.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" /></div>
<p>Sara discovered Music Together in 2006, when a friend recommended it to her after the birth of her first child. “I immediately thought that this program would be very stimulating for the development of my child, and also a great opportunity to have an activity to meet other mothers with children,” Sara recalls. Little did she know that Music Together would become an activity that she would continue to love for so many years, or that her household would blossom into a family of six—three boys and three girls! Over the years, she has enrolled all of her children in mixed-age classes from the time they were born through age four, with her youngest children still in attendance.</p>
<p>Sara goes to every class with her children, typically enrolling two siblings at a time. She enjoys the camaraderie that builds within the playful, safe environs of the class community. She also believes that the program has greatly enhanced her children’s interest in continuing to make music. “When the older children were young, they had a lot of fun ‘replaying’ the Music Together classes at home,” she says. “All my children have expressed an interest in learning to play instruments, and some have developed a real passion for it. Developing a passion for something is the most important thing of all for me.”</p>
<p>By now, Sara and her children are quite familiar with the Music Together collections; over the years they have enjoyed singing the songs at home, in the car, and as they go about their daily activities. The tunes have become a part of the children’s lives, with the older siblings passing on their favorites to the younger ones. And with so many songs to choose from, the music never gets old for this family. “We love all the songs, but in every collection we find ones that become our favorites. And when there are new songs that come out, that is always very entertaining!” remarks Sara. A few they especially like are “A Ram Sam Sam,” “All Around the Kitchen,” and “Dancing with Teddy.”</p>
<p>Soon, Sara will be making even <em>more</em> Music Together memories with the new baby she is expecting! She looks forward to continuing to share the wonder of music with her children as they learn and grow with Music Together. “Music…was the first language that my children learned,” says Sara. “And because all my children attended Music Together, we all ‘speak’ that same language. The songs are a lasting memory for everyone.”</p>

<p>Making music with your child can be so much fun for both of you, whether you’re singing along to the radio in the car, jamming on plastic bowl “drums,” or dancing to songs on your iPod.  Plus, music-making helps your child’s development in many important ways. The best part? You don’t have to have a great singing voice or play a musical instrument to have an impact. The simple and enjoyable act of making music with your child naturally fosters important social and emotional skills, such as self-regulation, self-confidence, leadership skills, social skills, and socio-emotional intelligence.</p>
<p>In fact, <a href="http://www.psmag.com/news/do-re-mi-promotes-a-feeling-of-we-19058/">recent research</a><a href="file:///C:/Users/206466109/Documents/PT%20-%20Blogs/Lauren%20Guilmartin/Music%20Early%20SEL%20Development/Guilmartin_Music&amp;SEL_SorayaReview.docx#_edn1">[i]</a> has found that preschoolers who engaged in participatory group music and movement activities showed greater group cohesion, cooperation, and prosocial behavior when compared to children who did not engage in the same music activities. Singing and dancing <em>together</em> led to increased empathy (the ability to understand and even share in the feelings of others) for the children with whom they were making music. <a href="http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2012/05/120509123653.htm">Even in infancy</a>,<a href="file:///C:/Users/206466109/Documents/PT%20-%20Blogs/Lauren%20Guilmartin/Music%20Early%20SEL%20Development/Guilmartin_Music&amp;SEL_SorayaReview.docx#_edn2">[ii]</a>adult-child music and movement interactions can lead to better communication and increased emotional and social coordination and connection, both rhythmically and emotionally, between the adult and the child. Researchers propose this might support infants’ earliest abilities to engage in positive social interactions with others.</p>
<p>So, you can have fun making music with your whole family and know that you are also supporting your child’s social and emotional growth. Here are some ideas for music activities you can try at home to specifically support several areas of socio-emotional learning.</p>
<div class="mobile-only" style="padding: 0.5em;" align="center"><img src="https://www.musictogether.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/MT-ClassroomPhoto-14-web-300x300.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="auto" /></div>
<img class="no-mobile" style="margin: 0.5em 2em 1em 0; float: left;" src="https://www.musictogether.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/MT-ClassroomPhoto-14-web-300x300.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="auto" />
<h4>Self-control and Self-regulation</h4>
<p>Singing a song like “A Ram Sam Sam” (from the Fiddle Song Collection), where you are challenged to incrementally leave out a phrase in the song, is a fun way for children to practice the crucial skill of <a href="http://bit.ly/10OIKTs">impulse control</a> in daily life. You can try this technique with <em>any song</em> you and your children know. As you sing a familiar tune, ask your child to leave out one of the words in the next lyric/phrase. During this game, children exercise self-control and self-regulation and experience what it feels like to resist doing something. It’s the same concept at work in the popular backyard game “Red Light, Green Light!”</p>
<h4>Self-confidence and Leadership Skills</h4>
<p>Ask your child to lead YOU in a favorite song, maybe one she learned at school or from your Music Together class. Just follow your child’s lead whether she gets the lyrics or melody “right” or not. This simple activity gives her a chance to be the leader—and supports her self-confidence as she experiences that her way of interpreting the song is accepted and embraced by you. Similarly, songs that ask children to come up with their own word or sound also support self-confidence and leadership skills. For example, in “One Little Owl” (from the Tambourine Song Collection), children can choose an animal to sing about and imitate its sound in their own way.</p>
<h4>Social Skills and Socio-emotional Intelligence</h4>
<p>Whether making music with just you or with the whole family, group music-making challenges children to work with others as an “ensemble.” They learn the importance of respecting others’ space and how they express themselves. They also get to practice working together towards a common goal (e.g., when holding hands while dancing). Respect, collaboration, and working as a team are all important social skills for your child to develop.</p>
<h4>Empathy Development</h4>
<p>Making music in a group also challenges children to watch the people around them for subtle cues to timing, volume, and expressiveness—the same cues that we use for reading expressions and moods on people’s faces. Being able to perceive and understand people’s feelings is a basis for empathy and moral development.</p>
<p>Actively making music with your child is a fun and easy way to support your child&#8217;s socio-emotional learning, helping them to develop self-regulation, self-confidence, leadership skills, social skills, and much more! So, the next time you sing with your child, try some of the activities suggested here. And remember, it doesn’t matter whether you consider yourself “musical.” Your joyful participation and enjoyment is what is most important!</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 1.25em; font-size: 1.25em; color: #fd4f57; line-height: 135%;">&#8220;Although humans are not usually born in litters, we seem to insist they be educated in them.&#8221; &#8211; Dr. Lilian Katz</p>
<div class="mobile-only" align="center"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1155 alignleft" src="https://www.musictogether.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/MT-Family-5-293_ffffff_full-500w-272x300.png" alt="" width="300" height="331" /></div>
<p>If you’re like many of us, you probably grew up learning in classrooms separated by age: First-graders in one room, second-graders in another, and so on. This is a common way to educate children, but it’s not the only way. You may have heard that Montessori schools combine multiple ages into each classroom, but did you know Music Together pioneered bringing mixed-age groupings to parent-child programs?</p>
<p>The resulting “family model” of early childhood education means that all members of a family can learn—and play!—together. Recent research on mixed-age classes highlights additional surprising benefits.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Benefit #1: True Empathy</strong>. Babies are born with the raw material to develop empathy, which often shows up as a reflex to mirror emotion, like when one baby cries and others cry, too. But in order for this potential to become what researchers call “true empathy,” children have to receive and give caring. This is rare in same-age schooling, but opportunities for nurturing exchanges abound in mixed-age classes.</li>
<li><strong>Benefit #2: Meeting children’s unique needs</strong>. As a new parent, you may have joined a Baby Play Group to find support in parenting an infant for the first time. Finding community, comparing experiences, and sharing challenges all help new parents feel supported. (What a lifesaver these groups can be for parent and baby!) If, however, that baby never gets the opportunity to socialize, explore, and learn outside of this same-age group, key developmental needs will go unmet. As children grow, mixed-age settings provide the opportunity to be nurtured and mentored by older children, and to offer caring and leadership to younger children.</li>
<li><strong>Benefit #3: Learning by teaching, leading, and modeling</strong>. In mixed-age play, older children learn by teaching, become leaders, and model for younger children. The little ones, in turn, emulate older children’s skills. You probably learned to tie your shoes by watching an older sibling, neighbor, or friend—one who took the time to patiently show you how to make loops, cross over, and pull until you got it right. In mixed-age groupings, younger children naturally turn to older children for guidance, and older children instinctively offer help to the younger ones.</li>
<li><strong>Benefit #4: More creativity, less competition</strong>. When children of multiple ages play together, the focus shifts from competing for limited resources (like toys and attention) to having fun! Children have more chances for deep, imaginative play, for exploring new ideas, and for working together in novel ways. Parents, too, in a mixed-age classroom are less likely to compare their child to others. Nagging questions like, “Should my child be clapping, too?” are more likely to move into the background. Instead, they catch a glimpse of what’s ahead for their child and mentor other parents with a little “been there, done that” wisdom.</li>
</ul>
<p>Luckily, Music Together families experience some of the benefits of mixed-age classes: fostering leadership, caring, empathy, and creativity—all of which support early music-learning and foster lifelong success in school and life.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 1.25em; font-size: 1.25em; color: #fd4f57; line-height: 135%;">When Peter and Stephanie Rich were choosing a name for their son, they knew they wanted a name that connected to harmony, and peace, and music. They were both very familiar with the Tony Award–winning tap dance master/choreographer Savion Glover, and they liked having a connection to an artist that they admired.</p>
<div class="mobile-only" align="center"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1414 alignleft" src="https://www.musictogether.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/SavionRichfamily-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></div>
<p>“After he was born and we saw our baby’s spirit, it just really clicked,” says Peter. “Savion: a name that speaks to a bringer of harmony, art, and peace.”  Savion and his parents carry on a connection to those same values in their class at Music Together of Ithaca, New York. In fact, Savion has become so attached to the music that his parents make sure that Music Together songs are playing during every car ride they take.</p>
<p>“We once took a three-hour drive to see family, and Savion didn’t do well—lots of crying,” Stephanie recalls. “So on our next trip, we used the Music Together app for music, and he was fine! Now, every day and everywhere we go, we play Music Together songs. It makes such a difference.”</p>
<p>Savion is particularly taken with the songs that Grandma Yvette sings, such as “John the Rabbit,” “One Little Owl,” and “All Around the Kitchen.”  Peter and Stephanie noticed that he seemed to gravitate towards her bluesy, soulful voice, and often stopped crying when he heard her singing. This piqued Peter’s curiosity, so he did a little research to find out more about Grandma Yvette, and discovered her <a href="https://www.musictogether.com/about/our-music/adult-singers"><u>bio on the Music Together website</u></a>. Imagine his surprise when he discovered that she was the mother of Savion Glover! “We were so excited!” Peter exclaims. “We already loved Grandma Yvette through her music, and then to find out this funny, cool coincidence. . . it was really incredible.”</p>
<p>Peter and Stephanie wish to thank Grandma Yvette for having such a positive influence in their lives, and for bringing little Savion so much joy through the music she sings with the Music Together band. “We appreciate her voice and her musicality; she brings love into the music, and that filters out into our home and into our Savion’s life,” says Stephanie. “It’s so great singing along with her, and her influence has really spread out to our whole family. It’s such a sweet story for our son and our early parenting years.” It’s pretty safe bet to assume that it’s a sweet story for Grandma Yvette and <em>her</em> son, too.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 1.25em; font-size: 1.25em; color: #fd4f57; line-height: 135%;">School concerts, seasonal community events, religious ceremonies, holiday hits playing on the radio—all offer abundant opportunities to take advantage of the physical and emotional benefits of music during the busy holiday season.</p>
<div class="mobile-only" align="center"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1367" src="https://www.musictogether.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Lights_StyleFrame-300x300.png" alt="" width="300" height="300" /></div>
<p>Music is a source of comfort and peace as well as connection between family and friends. It promotes development in babies and young children, bonds families across generations, and stimulates areas of the brain involved with motivation, reward, and emotion. Here are five reasons to make music this holiday season.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Music helps us create and recall powerful memories.</strong> Music can spark happy memories and is often an important part of treasured family traditions, especially around holidays. Singing while you decorate the tree, at a holiday party, or at a religious celebration can help form memories and bonds with extended family and friends that will be recalled for many years to come. Create a new musical tradition: Sing a favorite holiday song in the car on the way to your holiday celebrations. Then, do it again next year.</li>
<li><strong>Music relieves stress.</strong> There’s no doubt the holidays can be stressful. Did you know that singing can relieve stress? Studies show that singing has the ability to slow our pulse and heart rate, lower our blood pressure, and decrease the levels of stress hormone in our bodies. Making or listening to music can actually result in increased levels of dopamine, a neurotransmitter that stimulates the brain’s reward system. So, sing along to music in the car while navigating the mall parking lot or getting ready for company. It will help you stay calm and, most importantly, model for your children a healthy way to deal with the stress of everyday life.</li>
<li><strong>Music connects us.</strong> The holidays can be lonely for some people. Singing, especially in groups, can relieve this loneliness by connecting us to others in ways that no other activity can. Research indicates that music-making as a shared experience can activate and synchronize similar neural connections in all those participating. This alignment can result in feelings of empathy and shared intention that promote positive social interaction and bonding. When you sing with others this holiday season, during a religious service, at a community event, or at a family gathering, everyone reaps the benefits!</li>
<li><strong>Singing is intergenerational. </strong>Music is an ageless way to connect with older relatives and create ties between youngest and oldest family members. Plus, music supports the aging process. In later years, participating in music activities helps keep the brain active and engaged and supports us physically, socially, and emotionally. Sharing memories of holiday music-making from their past and teaching those songs to future generations can be happy for both elderly storytellers and the family members listening and forming new memories.</li>
<li><strong>Music-making is beneficial to children’s development. </strong>Music stimulates social, physical, cognitive, and emotional development and promotes language and concentration skills, confidence, and self-esteem. During the early years, active engagement with music promotes brain development and naturally supports growth essential to life and learning: That’s why we say music-learning supports all learning. Support your child’s development this holiday season: Sing your favorite carols in the car, jam to your holiday playlist, or go to a holiday concert or musical. (Check out performances at your local middle and high schools.)</li>
</ol>
<p>The magic of music shines exceptionally bright during the holiday season. We hope you’ll enjoy it and use the wealth of musical opportunities as a springboard for making music throughout the <em>entire</em> year.</p>
<p>Have a very musical holiday!</p>

<div class="mobile-only" align="center"><a title="Kids Music Day" href="http://www.kidsmusicday.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><br />
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1367" src="https://www.musictogether.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/KidsMusicDayLogo.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="300" /><br />

<p>Founded by the national nonprofit organization Keep Music Alive, Kids Music Day was created to inspire music schools, retailers, and other organizations to hold events that honor and benefit kids making music. This year, as part of Kids Music Day weekend, an estimated 800-1,000 participants worldwide will hold open houses, instrument petting zoos, student performances, community and/or family jams, drumming and ukulele circles, and instrument donation drives. Find one in your neighborhood by visiting <a href="http://www.kidsmusicday.org">www.kidsmusicday.org</a>.</p>
<p>Promoting the value of music in children’s education—the goal of Kids Music Day—is clearly consonant with the mission of Music Together, so many of our centers are celebrating with special events or offers from Monday, October 1, through Sunday, October 14. Ask your center director to find out if there’s anything planned near you!</p>
<p>Supporting Kids Music Day this year are several music industry leaders and other corporate sponsors, including CASIO EMI, Alfred Music, Remo, Conn-Selmer, Kala Brand Music, and Advantage Rent A Car. Celebrity artists, too, are showing their support for music education by signing on as Kids Music Day Ambassadors. Among these artists are such singers, songwriters, producers, composers, and instrumentalists as Julie Andrews, Richie Sambora, Nancy Wilson (Heart), Sarah McLachlan, Victor Wooten, Mandy Harvey, Jim Brickman, Bernie Williams, Siedah Garrett, Orianthi, Alma Deutscher, Todd Rundgren, Jan Hammer, Damien Escobar, Amy Holland, and Charlie Worsham.</p>
<p>Kids Music Day is actually one of two international holidays founded by Keep Music Alive. The other holiday, Teach Music Week, is held annually in March, and it also aligns closely with the principles of Music Together. In 2018, as part of the 4th Annual Teach Music Week, more than 600 music schools and retailers in the United States, Canada, and 10 additional countries offered free music lessons to new students—adults and children alike. March was chosen for this week-long celebration because March is also Music in Our Schools Month, doubly emphasizing how important it is for schools to include music in children’s education. (March is also our own appreciation month, Sing With Your Child Month.)</p>
<p>Keep Music Alive was founded in 2014 by husband-and-wife team Vincent James and Joann Pierdomenico to inspire more children and adults to enjoy the educational, social, and therapeutic effects of playing music. According to them, “[E]very child deserves the opportunity to learn how to play music, and every adult needs to be reminded that it’s never too late to start playing.” In addition to creating Kids Music Day and Teach Music Week, Keep Music Alive has published the book <em>88+ Ways Music Can Change Your Life</em>. Half the proceeds of sales of the book are donated to non-profits that support music instruction and education in schools and communities in need.</p>

<p>Since 2002, Little Kids Rock has been on a mission to restore and enhance music education in public schools. To date, they have donated over 75,000 instruments, curriculum tools, and professional development resources to K–12 and collegiate educators. Last winter, I was awarded a grant to start their Modern Band program at Buena Vista Elementary School. In Modern Band, students learn to perform and improvise popular music using guitar, bass, percussion, keyboard, and vocals.  </p>
<p>I was thrilled to be able to introduce Little Kids Rock and Modern Band to Buena Vista Elementary, and my students were equally excited.  Beginning in January 2018, fifth-grade students rehearsed once a week, quickly catching on to basic keyboard skills and simple guitar and ukulele chords. They named their band &#8220;The Dolphin Wonders&#8221; and were proud and excited by their renditions of &#8220;Best Day of My Life,&#8221; and &#8220;I Gotta Feeling.&#8221; My students loved being on stage as they showcased songs for friends, family, and the school community. </p>
<p>&#8220;I think it&#8217;s really cool that people care about kids and their music learning experiences,&#8221; said one student. Another chimed in: &#8220;Plus, it&#8217;s really fun to hang out with your friends and play songs together!&#8221;</p>
<p>I look forward to continuing and expanding the Modern Band program in the fall. This coming school year, my goal is to incorporate it into all of my classes, from grades kindergarten through five. This month, I am attending the Little Kids Rock Modern Band Summit in Fort Collins, Colorado! This four-day professional development conference includes teacher-led workshops, special guest speakers, and nightly jam sessions that foster creativity and community in a peer network of more than 2,000 Modern Band practitioners nationwide. I can&#8217;t wait to tell you all about it when I return!</p>
