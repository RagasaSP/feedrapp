<p>Chief Medical Officer, Hospice of Central PA</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Palliative care is a medical specialty that focuses on relief of physical, emotional, physiological and spiritual symptoms related to chronic and/or serious illness. Often, symptoms such as pain, anxiety, insomnia, shortness of breath, fatigue, nausea, and appetite loss can significantly impact a patient’s quality of life. Palliative medicine specialists aim to reduce the burden of these symptoms by focusing on individualized treatment strategies, addressing the “Whole Patient” and not just the disease process.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Palliative care includes a specialized team of physicians, nurses, social workers, and chaplains. We work alongside the patient, family, and other medical providers as a team. Specialists in palliative care see patients in hospitals, in their offices, in long term care facilitates, as well as in their homes.</p>
<p>Palliative care is NOT the same as hospice care. Palliative care may be provided at any time during a person’s illness. Often, palliative care is offered to patients at the same time they are receiving potentially life prolonging or curative treatments. Receiving palliative care does not prevent the patient from pursuing other services, treatments, or procedures.</p>
<p>Another goal of palliative care is to help patients and families better understand their illness in order to assist with complex medical decision making. We strive for a patient’s values and goals to be heard and appreciated so that they can make the best decision possible for their care.</p>
<p>A referral to a Palliative Medicine physician does not mean your medical provider is “giving up hope.” Often, patients who receive palliative care early on in their disease process benefit from superior symptom management, greater emotional support, and overall improved quality of life.</p>

<p>More than 1.6 million Pennsylvanians care for older parents, spouses or other loved ones, helping them to live independently at home. These family caregivers have a huge responsibility, and PA now has a law that will make life a little bit easier for them.</p>
<p>The CARE (Caregiver Advise, Record, Enable) Act helps family caregivers when their loved ones go into the hospital and as they transition home.</p>
<p>The CARE Act requires hospitals to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Provide your loved one the opportunity to designate a family caregiver.</li>
<li>Inform you when your loved one is to be discharged to another facility or back home.</li>
<li>Give you an explanation and demonstration of the medical tasks you will need to perform at home.</li>
</ul>

<p>&#8220;AARP is here in PA fighting for older Americans and their families said <strong>Joanne Grossi, PA State President AARP and Executive Vice President, PA Breast Cancer Coalition</strong>.  Because of the work of AARP, the CARE Act is now a reality for all Pennsylvanians. This crucial law gives essential information and support to caregivers, including families who are facing a breast cancer diagnosis and living with metastatic disease.  Caregiving is a big responsibility, and caregivers should have the important information that they need to safely care for their loved ones at home.&#8221;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>AARP Pennsylvania led the fight in PA for the CARE Act.

<p>HOW AND WHEN WAS YOUR BREAST CANCER FOUND?</p>
<p>I had my baseline mammogram when I was 28 years old after learning that my great grandmother had breast cancer. At that time, they told me I had dense breasts and the mammogram was cloudy because of my age. In September 2005 at age 44 I went for annual screening mammogram and there was a suspicious area on the film. I had additional views done and an ultrasound guided biopsy, then an MRI stereotactic biopsy. It was concluded that I had a malignant tumor and that I needed a mastectomy.</p>
<p>I had chemo prior to the surgery due to the size of the tumor. I’ll never forget the date of my surgery: it was on Good Friday 2006. I had a double mastectomy with reconstruction.</p>
<p>WHERE DID YOU FIND YOUR BEST SUPPORT?</p>
<p>Most of the support I had was through my church family at the Deliverance Baptist Church in Wilkinsburg, and my sister. My sister actually spent one of her birthdays with me at my chemo treatment.</p>
<p>I want to share one very special thing. Right before my surgery the surgeon was running behind. One of the ministers from my church, who is the bishop’s daughter, sat and sang to me until they came to take me to surgery.</p>
<p>HOW DID YO<img class="alignleft wp-image-7992 size-medium" src="http://www.pabreastcancer.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/P1010712-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" srcset="https://www.pabreastcancer.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/P1010712-300x225.jpg 300w, https://www.pabreastcancer.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/P1010712-768x576.jpg 768w, https://www.pabreastcancer.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/P1010712-1024x768.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />U LEARN ABOUT THE PBCC?</p>
<p>I went to a breast cancer support group at the YWCA in Pittsburgh after my first chemo treatment. The coordinator Yvonne Durham shared lots of information and a gift bag. Two weeks after that meeting I received a PBCC Friends Like Me care package. It was close to Christmas when it arrived and I thought it was a Christmas gift. A little note inside said that Yvonne had requested it for me. I cried going through everything because it made me feel special to think that such a wonderful thing could come because of having this awful disease.</p>
<p>YOU’VE BEEN TO THE PBCC CONFERENCE IN OCTOBER. WHAT WAS THAT LIKE FOR YOU?</p>
<p>My first two conferences were in 2016 and 2017. This past year I really enjoyed the opening session presentation by Dr. Hudis. He shared so much information and he’s so humble! I love that he’s still working with patients. Without the PBCC, I would not be able to continue learning about breakthroughs with treatment, research, and clinical trials. I share as much of that as I can, and I know that you’re doing it all in an effort to save lives. I’m truly thankful for the PBCC. You’re a sounding board and lasting voice for me and for other survivors.</p>
<p>IS THERE SOMETHING YOU WANT OTHER WOMEN TO REMEMBER?</p>
<p>Be aware of any changes in your breasts and don’t be afraid to voice them to your doctor. Be vigilant about having mammograms. Schedule it and show up!</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Uber Health or LyftForHealth may be able to help! Each of these popular ride companies are partnering with healthcare facilities to arrange transportation for patients and caregivers. The hospital books the ride in advance (or the day of the appointment) and the patient is notified by text when to expect the driver. If texting is not an option, the patient will receive a confirmation call from the hospital.</p>
<p>The passenger does not need an Uber or Lyft account; however, the hospital must be participating in the program. Check with your doctor or hospital to see if they might consider joining UberHealth or LyftForHealth, available anywhere that Uber and Lyft have services.</p>
