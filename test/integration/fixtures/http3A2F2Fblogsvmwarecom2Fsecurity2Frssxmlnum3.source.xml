				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h1>Architecture of AppDefense in Non-SaaS Setting</h1>
<p>The <a href="https://www.vmware.com/products/vsphere.html?src=WWW_us_VMW_7BbL4TZlFDu6nwQJCzxq&amp;int_cid=70134000001SkpZ">VMware vSphere Platinum</a> edition delivers advanced security capabilities fully integrated into the hypervisor. It combines the industry leading capabilities of vSphere with <a href="https://www.vmware.com/products/appdefense.html?src=WWW_us_VMW_7BbL4TZlFDu6nwQJCzxq&amp;int_cid=70134000001SkpZ">VMware AppDefense</a>, delivering purpose-built VMs to secure applications. vSphere Platinum secures infrastructure and applications by leveraging the hypervisor and the power of machine learning in a way that is built-in, operationally simple, and with minimal overhead or impact on performance. vSphere Platinum allows the vSphere Admin to deliver secure infrastructure and applications by enabling virtual machines to run in a “known good” state. AppDefense delivers key capabilities to protect applications running on vSphere. AppDefense understands an application’s intended state and behavior, then monitors for changes to that intended state.</p>
<p>VMware AppDefense has two components which include an on-prem appliance and SaaS component. This gives a flexibility to our customer to choose different connectivity model with AppDefense service. By default, the AppDefense Appliance enables only the AppDefense Plug-In in vCenter Server. Switching the AppDefense Appliance connectivity to SaaS enables the AppDefense Appliance to communicate with the AppDefense Service, enabling the complete solution.</p>
<p>In this blog post I will explain how to run VMware AppDefense [in non-SaaS mode]. This solution is perfect for most of federal customers who generally do not have internet connectivity from their appliances or decides to run AppDefense without SaaS subscription. With vSphere Platinum customers get an AppDefense Plugin in vCenter Server which provides them process &amp; network connection visibility within vCenter server. Now before I get into details of capabilities of AppDefense plugin let me discuss about the architecture of AppDefense in non-SaaS mode.</p>
<p>AppDefense has three components to get you the visibility inside your VMs i.e. on-prem appliance, host module and guest module. The AppDefense plugin and modules talk to the appliance over HTTPS. Within the AppDefense plugin you get all the process and network connection details.</p>
<img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-2656" src="http://blogs.vmware.com/security/files/2019/09/AppDefense-Multiple-Services-1024x521.png" alt="AppDefense Multiple Services" srcset="https://blogs.vmware.com/security/files/2019/09/AppDefense-Multiple-Services-1024x521.png 1024w, https://blogs.vmware.com/security/files/2019/09/AppDefense-Multiple-Services-300x153.png 300w, https://blogs.vmware.com/security/files/2019/09/AppDefense-Multiple-Services-768x391.png 768w, https://blogs.vmware.com/security/files/2019/09/AppDefense-Multiple-Services.png 1151w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" />
<p>The AppDefense appliance can run in offline mode or online mode i.e. with internet connectivity and no SaaS subscription. In the above architecture, the dotted HTTPS line to the AppDefense cloud indicates the online (SaaS) mode. Each mode has unique capability which it can provide to IT staff. In completely offline mode the customer has two advantages including:</p>
<p>1. One-click install workflows in vCenter; to perform module installations</p>
<img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-2657" src="http://blogs.vmware.com/security/files/2019/09/vCenter-one-click-install-1024x507.jpg" alt="vCenter one-click install" srcset="https://blogs.vmware.com/security/files/2019/09/vCenter-one-click-install-1024x507.jpg 1024w, https://blogs.vmware.com/security/files/2019/09/vCenter-one-click-install-300x149.jpg 300w, https://blogs.vmware.com/security/files/2019/09/vCenter-one-click-install-768x381.jpg 768w, https://blogs.vmware.com/security/files/2019/09/vCenter-one-click-install.jpg 1572w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" />
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. Process &amp; network visibility</p>
<img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-2658" src="http://blogs.vmware.com/security/files/2019/09/Network-Visibility-1024x426.jpg" alt="Network Visibility" srcset="https://blogs.vmware.com/security/files/2019/09/Network-Visibility-1024x426.jpg 1024w, https://blogs.vmware.com/security/files/2019/09/Network-Visibility-300x125.jpg 300w, https://blogs.vmware.com/security/files/2019/09/Network-Visibility-768x319.jpg 768w, https://blogs.vmware.com/security/files/2019/09/Network-Visibility.jpg 1552w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" />
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This provides customers and their IT staff with visibility inside of their VMs. Infrastructure teams can view the processes &amp; network connections details and identify process with network behaviors, execution path, CLI and arguments.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the case where a customer has internet connectivity, on their on-prem appliances they can take advantage of additional capabilities within plugin which include:</p>
<p>1. Software process reputation</p>
<img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-2659" src="http://blogs.vmware.com/security/files/2019/09/Software-Process-Reputation-1024x515.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://blogs.vmware.com/security/files/2019/09/Software-Process-Reputation-1024x515.jpg 1024w, https://blogs.vmware.com/security/files/2019/09/Software-Process-Reputation-300x151.jpg 300w, https://blogs.vmware.com/security/files/2019/09/Software-Process-Reputation-768x386.jpg 768w, https://blogs.vmware.com/security/files/2019/09/Software-Process-Reputation.jpg 1560w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" />
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The AppDefense plugin receives reputation score from our security partner, Carbon Black’s data feeds. This information is helpful for IT teams, as it helps them to quickly identify high risk processes running inside their VMs. Process reputation is calculated based on trust and threat score based on their hash values and network behavior. This view also gives a holistic view of protection coverage of your environment with information about hosts and VMs coverage.</p>
<p>2. Automatic upgrades</p>
<p>This option in the plugin allows customers to upgrade host and guest modules using one-click feature. It also reports status of module and version in the plugin. It allows infrastructure owners to plan and schedule upgrades of modules from the vCenter Server.</p>
<img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-2660" src="http://blogs.vmware.com/security/files/2019/09/Automatic-Upgrades-1024x516.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://blogs.vmware.com/security/files/2019/09/Automatic-Upgrades-1024x516.jpg 1024w, https://blogs.vmware.com/security/files/2019/09/Automatic-Upgrades-300x151.jpg 300w, https://blogs.vmware.com/security/files/2019/09/Automatic-Upgrades-768x387.jpg 768w, https://blogs.vmware.com/security/files/2019/09/Automatic-Upgrades.jpg 1568w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" />
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>Summary</strong></h2>
<p>If customers decide to run AppDefense in offline or non-SaaS mode, AppDefense plugin provides visibility into their VMs. The plugin provides all the capabilities to run, manage &amp; monitor AppDefense and to protect their VMs from running any malicious processes. This is helpful for our customers who have very controlled environment with no internet connectivity as well. The AppDefense plugin makes thing easier for a vSphere Administrator to monitor and address threats because this allows the administrator to quickly correlate those threats to objects, they manage instead of IP addresses or ports. Furthermore, we can see what is happening within an individual VM in the Hosts and Clusters view that we tend to spend most of our time in.</p>
<p>Finally, as you can see that the vCenter Server plugin for vSphere Platinum creates a way for vSphere Administrators to easily monitor and collaborate with the Security Team to create an even more secure and efficient virtual infrastructure.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h1>Takeaways from VMworld 2019 as an Intern</h1>
<p>VMworld 2019 has been marked on my calendar since the first day of my internship, and it certainly did not disappoint. As you have probably already heard, VMworld 2019 was a huge success! VMworld kicked off Sunday, August 25th as attendees registered and visited the Solutions Exchange to fill their VMworld bags to the brim with swag (myself included). The conference lasted through Thursday, September 29th and was packed with tons of keynotes, technical sessions, workshops and other significant events.</p>
<img class="aligncenter wp-image-2637 size-large" src="http://blogs.vmware.com/security/files/2019/09/Stanton-Thomas-Cover-1024x768.jpeg" alt="Stanton Thomas Cover" width="580" height="435" srcset="https://blogs.vmware.com/security/files/2019/09/Stanton-Thomas-Cover-1024x768.jpeg 1024w, https://blogs.vmware.com/security/files/2019/09/Stanton-Thomas-Cover-300x225.jpeg 300w, https://blogs.vmware.com/security/files/2019/09/Stanton-Thomas-Cover-768x576.jpeg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 580px) 100vw, 580px" />
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For the duration of the conference, I had the opportunity of working the vSphere Platinum demo station in the VMware booth, on behalf of the AppDefense team &#8211; which provided me excellent insight into the minds of our customers. It was here that I was able to run through demos, answer questions, and address concerns about AppDefense. While tiring, “booth duty” was an invaluable experience that allowed me to learn more about what customers are looking for in a security product, in addition to which <a href="https://blogs.vmware.com/vsphere/2019/08/vmware-appdefense-breaks-down-silos-in-latest-release.html">new AppDefense features</a> they’re most excited about. As expected, an overwhelming amount of questions surrounded the recent announcement of <a href="https://blogs.vmware.com/security/2019/08/vmware-announces-intent-to-acquire-carbon-black.html">VMware’s intent to acquire Carbon Black</a>. Overall, there was a noticeable buzz of excitement in the air as people wait to see what future of VMware has in store.</p>
<img class="aligncenter wp-image-2638 size-large" src="http://blogs.vmware.com/security/files/2019/09/Stanton-Thomas-AppDefense-e1567726796645-768x1024.jpeg" alt="Stanton Thomas AppDefense" width="580" height="773" srcset="https://blogs.vmware.com/security/files/2019/09/Stanton-Thomas-AppDefense-e1567726796645-768x1024.jpeg 768w, https://blogs.vmware.com/security/files/2019/09/Stanton-Thomas-AppDefense-e1567726796645-225x300.jpeg 225w" sizes="(max-width: 580px) 100vw, 580px" />
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>On the second day of the conference, Nolan Karpinski<strong> </strong>of the AppDefense team delivered a very informative <a href="https://videos.vmworld.com/global/2019?q=appdefense">breakout session</a> that covered a demo and use cases of AppDefense. During the breakout session, I couldn’t help but notice how attentive the audience was as they quickly took notes on their laptops. It truly brought me joy to see all of the hard work done by the AppDefense team pay off.</p>
<p>Benjamin Franklin’s phrase “An Ounce of Prevention is worth a Pound of Cure” is the motto that Tom Corn carried throughout his <a href="https://videos.vmworld.com/global/2019?q=Tom%2520Corn">showcase keynote on Intrinsic security</a>. During this keynote, Tom laid out the current state and vision for VMware in the cybersecurity space, only adding to the already built-up excitement surrounding VMware’s partnership with Carbon Black. There was even a live attack demo led by Nolan Karpinski and Evin Hernandez of the AppDefense team, allowing the audience to experience first-hand how AppDefense works. Kudos to Tom and the rest of the AppDefense team on a successful keynote.</p>
<p>This wouldn’t be a VMworld recap blog without mentioning the amount of fun that took place in the beautiful city by the bay. The team dinners, activities, and parties were unforgettable. These activities allowed me to form relationships and deepen bonds with my coworkers. I couldn’t imagine a better way to end my summer as a VMware Intern. A special thank you goes out to my mentor Paige Schmidt and the rest of the AppDefense team, as they played an instrumental role in making this the best summer of my life!</p>

<h1><span class="TextRun SCXW18825077 BCX0" lang="EN-US" xml:lang="EN-US" data-contrast="auto"><span class="NormalTextRun SCXW18825077 BCX0">Accelerating VMware’s Vision for Intrinsic Security</span></span><span class="EOP SCXW18825077 BCX0" data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233117&quot;:true,&quot;134233118&quot;:true}"> </span></h1>
<p>By now you will have seen the announcement of our intent to acquire <a href="https://www.carbonblack.com/">Carbon Black</a>. This is a major milestone for VMware and for the security industry at large. It is also the culmination of several years of work executing on our vision and strategy for security.</p>
<p>Carbon Black is a pioneer of next generation endpoint security. With over 5,600 customers, and over 500 partners, they are a leader in endpoint detection and response. They have built a smart lightweight agent for a broad set of devices and workload endpoints with big data security analytics that’s built on scalable multi-tenant, cloud-native architecture.</p>
<h2>The Current State of Security</h2>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">VMware believes that security is in dire need of transformation.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233117&quot;:true,&quot;134233118&quot;:true}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">It needs to shift from a bolted-on model with thousands of point products, agents and appliances, all focused on different points of infrastructure — to a built-in model where the technology is embedded into the cloud and mobile fabric, and security becomes a distributed service rather than point tools.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233117&quot;:true,&quot;134233118&quot;:true}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Cybersecurity needs to shift from a reactive model that focuses on reverse engineering the attacks of yesterday, to a proactive approach that focuses on your applications, and looking at the </span><span data-contrast="auto">behavior of everything that touches or composes your applications; workloads, networks, devices and users.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233117&quot;:true,&quot;134233118&quot;:true}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">And it needs to shift from a siloed model, where different teams (InfoSec, </span><span data-contrast="auto">vAdmins</span><span data-contrast="auto">, End User services teams, networking) each have their own tools, policies, data/telemetry and each have their own isolated view of the world — to an aligned model that brings these worlds together. Security is a team sport. And teams need a single version of the truth.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233117&quot;:true,&quot;134233118&quot;:true}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">VMware’s overarching strategy is to be the digital foundation for any cloud, any app and any device. We are, in a very real sense, the fabric or operating system of the modern cloud and mobile world. Our security strategy has been to leverage this unique position to enable visibility and context into the applications we are trying to protect, analytics to make sense of that data and understand the behavior of the application on a workload, network, device and from a user perspective then provide flexible enforcement points to lock them down – creating least privilege/zero trust environments.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233117&quot;:true,&quot;134233118&quot;:true}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">With technologies like </span><a href="https://www.vmware.com/products/nsx.html?src=WWW_us_VMW_7BbL4TZlFDu6nwQJCzxq&amp;int_cid=70134000001SkpZ"><span data-contrast="none">VMware NSX</span></a><span data-contrast="auto">, </span><a href="https://www.vmware.com/products/appdefense.html?src=WWW_us_VMW_7BbL4TZlFDu6nwQJCzxq&amp;int_cid=70134000001SkpZ"><span data-contrast="none">VMware AppDefense</span></a><span data-contrast="auto">, </span><a href="https://go.cloudhealthtech.com/vmware-secure-state?src=WWW_us_VMW_7BbL4TZlFDu6nwQJCzxq&amp;int_cid=70134000001SkpZ"><span data-contrast="none">VMware Secure State</span></a><span data-contrast="auto"> and </span><a href="https://www.vmware.com/products/workspace-one.html?src=WWW_us_VMW_7BbL4TZlFDu6nwQJCzxq&amp;int_cid=70134000001SkpZ"><span data-contrast="none">VMware Workspace ONE</span></a><span data-contrast="auto"> we have made huge progress executing against that vision. But with Carbon Black we raise the bar to a completely different level.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233117&quot;:true,&quot;134233118&quot;:true}"> </span></p>
<h2>VMware and Carbon Black</h2>
<p>Our journey with Carbon Black is not new. In fact, it started over 2.5 years ago with a deep partnership with our AppDefense team. It was clear from the onset that we held the same beliefs about the problem, we held the same vision for the future, and have the same culture of deep technical innovation. It was also clear that we each solved complementary parts of this puzzle. VMware has the intrinsic position to see all the data, behaviors in context. Carbon Black has the big data security analytics to make sense of all that data. And VMware has the built-in control points to enforce and react. Simply put; We can see it. They can understand it. Together we can act on it.</p>
<p>Carbon Black will be the heart of our intrinsic security platform. It will provide world class solutions for securing user devices, workloads in private and public clouds, and their security cloud will be the heart of our security analytics. And like everything we do, we will enable our partner ecosystem to benefit from these new intrinsic capabilities.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h1><strong>Things to note before upgrading</strong></h1>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is easy to upgrade <a href="https://www.vmware.com/products/appdefense.html?src=WWW_us_VMW_7BbL4TZlFDu6nwQJCzxq&amp;int_cid=70134000001SkpZ">AppDefense</a> to the <a href="https://www.vmware.com/products/vsphere.html?src=WWW_us_VMW_7BbL4TZlFDu6nwQJCzxq&amp;int_cid=70134000001SkpZ">vSphere Platinum</a> version if you have already deployed AppDefense prior to upgrading to <a href="https://blogs.vmware.com/vsphere/2018/10/whats-new-in-vcenter-server-6-7-update-1.html">6.7u1</a>. With the Platinum version you will be able to view the AppDefense plug-in (on-premise) in vCenter. This will allow you to easily deploy the AppDefense module to the host and guest, see processes on the VMs, and view integrity checks through vCenter.</p>
<p>There are a few pre-requisites to be able to upgrade:</p>
<ul>
<li>Purchased vSphere Platinum licenses (Need help? <a href="mailto:appdefense-sales@vmware.com?subject=I'd%20like%20to%20purchase%20vSphere%20Platinum">Contact us</a>.)</li>
<li>Deployed AppDefense in a 6.5 vCenter</li>
<li>Upgraded to vCenter 6.7u1</li>
<li>Have SSO admin credentials (for AppDefense? Or vCenter?)</li>
</ul>
<p>Once you have confirmed the pre-requisites you can begin the upgrade process with 7 simple steps.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h1>Increasing Application Visibility with VMware AppDefense</h1>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1042" src="http://blogs.vmware.com/security/files/2019/08/Image1blog-1024x563.png" alt="" />
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p>Do you know what&#8217;s been hiding in your applications? The truth is, most of the infrastructure teams we work with today don’t have a comprehensive answer to this question. VI Admins don’t always have visibility (out of the box) into the applications or processes running in their environment. Fortunately, <a href="https://www.vmware.com/products/appdefense.html?src=WWW_us_VMW_7BbL4TZlFDu6nwQJCzxq&amp;int_cid=70134000001SkpZ">AppDefense</a> provides a detailed view into application process and behavior which tend to surface some unknowns for customers in their applications. Here are the three distinct customer profiles have that have emerged since we launched in 2017:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Customer A </strong>has no visibility into applications and needs to understand them more.</li>
<li><strong>Customer B </strong>has no visibility to E-W communication between VMs and VM integrity.</li>
<li><strong>Customer C</strong> knows their applications and wants to implement Zero Trust.</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>VMware AppDefense can provide a solution for each of these scenarios.</p>
<p>Let’s review each of the customer profiles in more detail to learn how AppDefense can help.</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<h2><strong>Customer A = No Visibility into Applications </strong></h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Customer Profile = Small Business</strong></p>
<p>Customer A typically does not have access to the application development team and does not have an extensive security team. Therefore, Customer A is often unaware of how the application should work and whether there are any potential threatening behavior(s) or process(es). Without visibility and application knowledge, Customer A is highly susceptible to attacks and potentially suffers from the inability to locate source of a threat for an undetermined amount of time.</p>
<p>AppDefense can help Customer A by providing them with both visibility and built-in process intelligence. This includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Scope Dashboard – The Scope Dashboard provides an overview of all the services in a scope. Any suspicious, malicious processes, or integrity issues will appear in red.</li>
<li>Process Scores and Process Path- Most processes will have a reputation score and will be identified if they&#8217;re anomalous behavior.</li>
<li>Process Hash- This will allow for further investigation if needed.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1044" src="http://blogs.vmware.com/security/files/2019/08/AppDefense-Protected-Behavior-1024x497.png" alt="AppDefense Protected Behavior" />
<p><em> </em></p>
<p><em>What <strong>Customer A</strong> will achieve with AppDefense</em>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Verified and known processes- AppDefense will highlight process to focus on (bad or unverified) and which processes are classified as known good.</li>
<li>Verify that company security policies are being carried out &#8211; are applications communicating over proper ports? Are people using public internet in Data Center Applications?</li>
</ul>
<p>Upon deployment of AppDefense, Customer A will have a better understanding of their applications, be able to templatize these applications to see any deviations, and immediately identify potentially threatening behavior.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>Customer B = No Visibility into East – West Traffic</strong></h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Customer Profile: Med &#8211; Large Customer</strong></p>
<p>Customer B has a strong affinity to security but has some major gaps in visibility from east- west process communication between VMs in their datacenter. Furthermore, they do not have information on VM guest integrity. The implication for Customer B’s lack of visibility into east-west communication and guest integrity leaves them vulnerable to internal breaches.</p>
<p>AppDefense has been able to help Customer B by showing intra-VM traffic and guest integrity checks.</p>
<ul>
<li>Topology View- The topology view illustrates the process between services.</li>
<li>Guest Integrity and AppDefense Module integrity- AppDefense will highlight the 9 integrity checks and if at any point something has been changed in the kernal AppDefense will alert on it.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1045" src="http://blogs.vmware.com/security/files/2019/08/AppDefense-Topology-View-1024x410.png" alt="AppDefense Topology View" />
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>What <strong>Customer B</strong> achieves with AppDefense: </em></p>
<ul>
<li>Visibility into all process communication among VMs (depending on how you set up VMs in Services)</li>
<li>Visibility and ability to take action on guest and AppDefense Module Integrity</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>Customer C = Wants to implement Zero Trust</strong></h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Customer Profile: Large customer (SOC team)</strong></p>
<p>Customer C is aware of what their application should do, but lacks the visibility and control to see deviations and act upon them accordingly. Customer C is unable to react to deviations if they are not able to create and use an application template to lock down known good processes and behaviors.</p>
<p>AppDefense can help Customer C with:</p>
<ul>
<li>Creating a verified behavior list. This list will be based on the Application/VM template Customer C has.</li>
<li>Setting up rules based on deviations &#8211; Customer C can specify actions they want to take when process or behavior deviations occur.</li>
<li>Blacklist &#8211; Customer C can use this to highlight processes that need to be marked critical.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1046" src="http://blogs.vmware.com/security/files/2019/08/AppDefense-Undeclared-Alarms-1024x155.png" alt="AppDefense Undeclared Alarms" />
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>What Customer C achieves with AppDefense: </em></p>
<ul>
<li>Create clear application Manifests (verified behavior list)</li>
<li>Create rules based on deviations from the verified behavior list</li>
<li>Identify/add behaviors to the Blacklist- this will create critical alerts for this process.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the three use cases above, we were able to illustrate how AppDefense provides value to VMware customers. VMware AppDefense is a hypervisor-native workload protection platform for enterprise virtualization and security teams and delivers the most secure virtual infrastructure and simplifies micro-segmentation planning. AppDefense reduces the attack surface by modeling intended application behavior, monitoring for anomalous behavior, and providing deep application visibility, reputation scoring, and security. AppDefense is simple for teams to install and operationalize. it is an intrinsic part of vSphere Platinum, so it is easy to leverage what you already own and run.

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h1>Whitelisting and Blacklisting in AppDefense</h1>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.vmware.com/products/appdefense.html?src=WWW_us_VMW_7BbL4TZlFDu6nwQJCzxq&amp;int_cid=70134000001SkpZ">VMware AppDefense</a> provides deeper visibility into data center endpoints by providing  information of each process running inside application servers along with their network connection details. With greater visibility into application servers, AppDefense can be used to manage processes across your environment to have granular control over what should be allowed or blocked (otherwise known as process whitelist and blacklist).</p>
<p>Most organizations have a common set of software programs that run on every VM in the data center such as Antivirus/EDR processes. VMware AppDefense helps security and/or infrastructure administrators help identify these processes and add them to a whitelist. The advantages of whitelisting these processes are that AppDefense won’t need to learn these common processes for every scope/service in your AppDefense organization. Once detection for <em>upgrade events </em>is performed, these processes won&#8217;t be required again.</p>
<p>However, admins must be mindful when whitelisting these processes, as it can introduce vulnerabilities in your environment. For example, processes related to Java and Python should not be whitelisted within an AppDefense organization as their behavior depends on the programs using them.</p>
<p>Similarly, blacklisting processes with AppDefense provides benefit to the administrators. Imagine having identified a process in your environment as malicious &#8211; blacklisting that process will ensure that it is not allowed in any other scope in your organization. Basically, AppDefense ensures blacklist processes are not added in the allowed behavior in any of the scopes in the organization.</p>
<p>Processes within AppDefense can be whitelisted or blacklisted from two different pages i.e. Event Details Page.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1029" src="http://blogs.vmware.com/security/files/2019/08/AppDefense-Event-Details-Page-1024x467.jpg" alt="AppDefense Event Details Page" />
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Another way to add the processes to whitelist/blacklist within AppDefense manager console is from the Behaviors Page.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1030" src="http://blogs.vmware.com/security/files/2019/08/AppDefense-Behaviors-Page-1024x470.jpg" alt="AppDefense Behaviors Page" />
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Finally, you can monitor the whitelist/blacklist processes in your AppDefense organization from the Manage Processes page and allows you to remove any of the processes from the list as well. For example, users can add noisy security agent as a whitelisted process. Then, the Alarm Classification Engine can de-classify alerts from that security agent with the abnormal behaviors.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In this blog I provided the details on managing processes with VMware AppDefense. This feature gives visibility to the security teams on their application interaction and provides a more comprehensive set of whitelisting/blacklisting. AppDefense also provides adaptive whitelisting, which adjusts the allowed behavior list to not penalize common changes that occur such as upgrade events. As mentioned, whitelisting is about managing legitimate software changes since this is where most false positives occur.</p>

<h1>Discovery Phase and Protected Mode</h1>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.vmware.com/products/appdefense.html?src=WWW_us_VMW_7BbL4TZlFDu6nwQJCzxq&amp;int_cid=70134000001SkpZ">VMware AppDefense</a> learns your data center’s (good) behaviors during the Discovery phase of deployment. This phase typically lasts between 2-3 weeks and provides users with visibility into all the processes and network connection details in their environment, along with guest integrity checks for security and/or infrastructure engineers. After a virtual machine has been moved to Protected mode, AppDefense sends alerts based on the rule settings set at the service in the manager console. Alerts page provides a way to monitor the deviations from the known good state of a VM.</p>
<p>VMware AppDefense categorizes alerts based on their threat level which can be viewed by logging into AppDefense Manager. Each alert is based on the process name hence, you can see multiple alerts for the same VM and/or scope. In the alerts page, AppDefense shows alerts which are highest in severity.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1011" src="http://blogs.vmware.com/security/files/2019/08/Alerts-in-AppDefense-Manager-1024x468.jpg" alt="Alerts in AppDefense Manager" />
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As you can see, AppDefense generates different types and categories of alerts and events. In this blog we will be focusing on the Alerts page only. However, the Alerts page displays the event type column which shows all the types of events generated by AppDefense. Now. Let’s get started…</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>Types of Alerts</strong></h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The AppDefense guest module monitors network &amp; process attestation along with guest integrity checks for Windows based systems. The main event types include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Process &amp; Network monitoring events</strong></li>
<li><strong>OS Integrity events</strong></li>
<li><strong>Management events</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>There are additional categories of events under each event type. I am going to explain these sub-categories further by defining the event types.</p>
<p>Process and Network monitoring events subcategories &#8211;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Process Monitoring events – This type of event is generated when AppDefense notices:</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>New Process:</strong> This could be due to change in process md5, sha256 hash or full path</li>
<li><strong>New CLI:</strong> This could be due to execution of an allowed process with new parameters</li>
<li><strong>New Behavior:</strong> Due to learning of new behavior for a combination of allowed process &amp; CLI</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In order to tag the severity to an event, AppDefense performs up to two checks. Process reputation threat and trust score, which are provided by Carbon Black data feeds, and IP reputation, which is provided by the AppDefense ML model. Other than these subcategories we have another type of event which monitors whether the new process is an upgrade of an existing allowed process by AppDefense. These types of events are categorized as Upgrade Events and can be monitored from the events page.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1012" src="http://blogs.vmware.com/security/files/2019/08/Process-Monitoring-Events-Subcategories-1024x469.jpg" alt="Process Monitoring Events Subcategories" />
<h3></h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>OS Integrity Events – All types of events in this category are highest in severity and are visible in the alerts page:</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>AppDefense Module Integrity:</strong> Checks the AppDefense module’s code section for unauthorized manipulation</li>
<li><strong>Guest OS Integrity:</strong> Checks the OS kernel for unauthorized manipulation</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>These events are generated by performing nine integrity and code checks in the module and OS kernel. I’ve included a brief overview below:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Guest Integrity Data: Checking the AppDefense module’s <strong>data section</strong> for unauthorized manipulation</li>
<li>Guest Integrity Heap: Checking the AppDefense module’s<strong> data heap section</strong> for unauthorized manipulation</li>
<li>Guest Integrity Hooks: Checking for any unauthorized manipulation of the callback hooks registered by the AppDefense module</li>
<li>Kernel Code: Checking for unauthorized manipulation of the NTOS kernel’s code section</li>
<li>Kernel Data: Checking for unauthorized manipulation of certain kernel data structures like the Interrupt descriptor table (IDT), Global descriptor table (GDT) and System service dispatch table (SSDT)</li>
<li>Reconcile Module: Checking the system for hidden kernel modules. AppDefense can see these processes, but they are being hidden (likely maliciously) from the operating system</li>
<li>Reconcile Process: Checking the system for hidden processes. AppDefense can see these modules, but they are being hidden (likely maliciously) from the operating system</li>
<li>Third-party Driver Code: Checking the code section of all drivers loaded in the system for unauthorized manipulation</li>
<li>Verify Signature: Verifying the signature of all drivers loaded in the system (with embedded signatures)</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Management Events – There are two types of alerts under this category and both event types are of critical severity.</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Management alerts</strong> are triggered when a blocking rule is set at the scope and an upgrade event is detected followed by a block action. As per the block rule action is taken by guest module at the OS level to block the execution of a new process which is later recognized as an upgrade event by AppDefense verification cloud.</li>
<li><strong>Guest Module Down</strong> events are triggered when an active guest in AppDefense stops sending heartbeats to AppDefense manager cloud.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>Summary</strong></h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In this blog I focused on alerts and events generated in VMware AppDefense. We also reviewed subcategories and scenarios in which each alert is generated in the AppDefense manager. Having a clear understanding of the alert types in AppDefense and what causes them will help customers respond to events generated by AppDefense to protect their organization’s critical workloads and applications.</p>
