Specifically, thermoplastics can overtake bulky metal enclosures due to their superior weight, EMI shielding capabilities, and simpler manufacturing process. However, before purchasing any thermoplastic, it is important to consider performance capabilities.</p>\n\n&nbsp;\n\nSingle pellet vs multi-pellet dry blend\n\n<p><a href=\"http://solutions.parker.com/premier-electrically-conductive-plastics\">Electrically conductive thermoplastics</a> are typically sold as a pellet blend of two or more components, made up from a variety of base polymers and stainless steel pellets. In small applications and sizes, these blends can generally be effective but are always bound to have consistency issues. In transportation and handling the stainless-steel pellets will settle to the bottom, resulting in an inconsistently shielded final product. This problem becomes more evident when molders run large quantities of parts and when they store the mix in large containers.<br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://solutions.parker.com/premier-electrically-conductive-plastics\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"Discover a New Electrically Conductive Flame Retardant Plastic - Pellets - Parker Chomerics\" src=\"https://cdn.app.compendium.com/uploads/user/a862d463-3ea6-443a-9187-e1040e91eb0e/e0db395c-5386-461b-8f02-7fa1ee5986c8/Image/3d4642b217302e8379c79f8707070e2a/multi_pellet_vs_single_pellet_1000x1000.png\" style=\"width: 600px; height: 600px; margin-right: 15px; margin-left: 15px; float: right; border-width: 0px; border-style: solid;\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Selecting a one pellet plastic material, like Parker Chomerics <a href=\"https://ph.parker.com/us/en/premier-pbt-conductive-plastic-pellets\">PREMIER PBT 250-FR</a>, eliminates this problem, since there is no mixing of pellets. Instead of having stainless steel pellets as a separate component, stainless steel fibers are pultruded into the plastic pellets to provide shielding. Single pellet thermoplastics can be sold in large quantities, unlike pellet mixes.</p>\n\n&nbsp;\n\nDifferent types of flame retardant ratings\n\n<p><a href=\"http://solutions.parker.com/premier-electrically-conductive-plastics\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"Discover a New Electrically Conductive Flame Retardant Plastic - Flammability - Parker Chomerics\" src=\"https://cdn.app.compendium.com/uploads/user/a862d463-3ea6-443a-9187-e1040e91eb0e/e0db395c-5386-461b-8f02-7fa1ee5986c8/Image/438d3def1026343b24d49f464e8f43a0/e7f85e65_67a9_4305_ae5d_532e363f4106__2_.png\" style=\"width: 650px; height: 250px; margin-left: 15px; margin-right: 15px; float: left;\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Understanding the plastic&rsquo;s UL 94 rating will help determine how it will perform under fire hazard conditions. In order to receive the UL 94 5VA certification, the plastic must stop burning after 60 seconds on a vertical plaque, with no drips or holes, according to the UL website. This rating, is the highest level of flammability resistance for any thermoplastic. The next rating down, UL 94 V-0, means the plastic can stop burning within 10 seconds on a vertical specimen and the drips are non-flammable. Most thermal plastics that are electrically conductive fall under the UL 94 V-0 rating and require an extra coating to be EMI shielded. But Parker Chomerics PREMIER PBT 250-FR earns a 5VA rating at 2.5 mm thickness without the need of a coating to achieve electrical conductivity.</p>\n\n&nbsp;\n\nCompared to metal enclosures\n\n<p>In addition, <a href=\"http://solutions.parker.com/premier-electrically-conductive-plastics#why\">plastics</a>&nbsp;can also be more cost effective than metal enclosures. Although metals are typically more cost effective initially, the secondary machining requirements of</p>\n\n<p>many metal components can add significant cost and lead time. For example, many die cast parts require machining operations to drill and tap threads while most thermoplastics can be molded with pre-formed holes and use thread forming screws. Also, plastics are significantly lighter than metal enclosures, helping to better achieve light-weighting goals.</p>\n\n&nbsp;\n\nApplications\n\n<p>Parker Chomerics <a href=\"http://solutions.parker.com/premier-electrically-conductive-plastics\">PREMIER PBT 250-FR</a>, a single pellet UL 94 5VA electrically conductive thermoplastic, is known for its excellent performance where petrochemical exposure is common.&nbsp;Typical applications include retail fuel dispenser pumps, housings, dispensers and face plates, electronic payment terminal housings, security access points, and more.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://ph.parker.com/us/en/premier-pbt-conductive-plastic-pellets/pskt-pbt-250-fr\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"Discover a New Electrically Conductive Flame Retardant Plastic - Buy Sample - Parker Chomerics\" src=\"https://cdn.app.compendium.com/uploads/user/a862d463-3ea6-443a-9187-e1040e91eb0e/e0db395c-5386-461b-8f02-7fa1ee5986c8/Image/e9501ebe364dce8f3db4ef256390645e/e7f85e65_67a9_4305_ae5d_532e363f4106__3_.png\" style=\"width: 600px; height: 231px; margin-left: 15px; margin-right: 15px; float: left;\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"Discover a New Electrically Conductive Flame Retardant Plastic - Paige Ludl - Parker Chomerics\" src=\"https://cdn.app.compendium.com/uploads/user/a862d463-3ea6-443a-9187-e1040e91eb0e/e0db395c-5386-461b-8f02-7fa1ee5986c8/Image/ed59d3db2f9a50e9a9e760321feb70ab/paige_ludl_headshot_144x144.jpg\" style=\"width: 144px; height: 144px; margin-left: 15px; margin-right: 15px; float: left;\" /></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>This blog contributed by Page Ludl, marketing co-op, <a href=\"http://www.parker.com/chomerics\">Chomerics Division</a>.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Related content:</p>\n\n<p><span><a href=\"http://blog.parker.com/improved-emi-shielding-consistency-of-single-pellet-conductive-plastics\">Improved EMI Shielding Consistency of Single Pellet Conductive Plastics</a> </span></p>\n\n<p><span><a href=\"http://blog.parker.com/best-conductive-plastics-five-things-to-look-for\">Best Conductive Plastics: Five Things to Look For </a> </span></p>\n\n<p><span><a href=\"http://blog.parker.com/why-you-should-single-source-emi-shielding-materials\">Why You Should Single-Source EMI Shielding Materials</a> </span></p>\n",

They&rsquo;re costly to maintain and operate, generate waste that can have a significant impact on local environments and nature, and use global resources to construct and operate. In fact, it has been estimated that the daily operation of buildings accounts for 40% of total energy usage worldwide. Now, enter the world of green building.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\nCommercial green building is on the rise--and keeps growing\n\n<p>Green building is the practice of designing, constructing and operating buildings to maximize occupant health and productivity, use fewer resources, reduce waste and negative environmental impacts, and decrease life cycle costs.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>How big is the movement? It&rsquo;s big. Building owners expect to build more than 60 percent of their projects as green buildings by 2021. Decreased operating costs, short payback periods and asset value increases were strong drivers of green building, but creating healthier indoor environments was also a major motivator.</p>\n\n<p>In addition, a rating system such as LEED allows builders to create a better-performing building. LEED, or Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design, is the most widely used green building rating system in the world. It&rsquo;s a system that&rsquo;s now broadening its focus on construction to include maintenance and the long-term sustainment of energy efficiency.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://solutions.parker.com/HVAC-Trends-WP\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"Download How to Capitalize on HVAC/R Trends to Drive Business Growth white paper\" src=\"https://cdn.app.compendium.com/uploads/user/a862d463-3ea6-443a-9187-e1040e91eb0e/b44b1afd-00b2-4096-87a7-b9a574ad823f/Image/899828c70f4bf54d17f966dd73c40982/parkerdownloadwhitepaper.jpg\" style=\"width: 200px; height: 29px; margin-left: 15px; margin-right: 15px; float: right;\" /></a>Download our white paper, <a href=\"http://solutions.parker.com/HVAC-Trends-WP\" target=\"_blank\">How to Capitalize on HVAC/R Trends to Drive Business Growth</a> and learn what actions contractors and distributors must take now, to capitalize on environmental responsibility trends.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\nThe key to meeting greenhouse gas targets\n\n<p>Lowering a building&rsquo;s initial energy consumption is critical to meeting greenhouse gas targets. On the maintenance side, energy savings alone from properly maintained building systems could be 2 to 5 percent or more. From a greenhouse gas standpoint, consumption is 95 percent of the impact&nbsp;of an air conditioning/heating operation. Properly maintained systems perform much better. Refrigerant leakage is prevented but also prevents consumption.</p>\n\n<p>With LEED recertification programs now focused on upkeep, HVAC and refrigeration system maintenance professionals have an opportunity to play a bigger role with facilities managers and/ or building owners. One way to take advantage of that opportunity is by becoming a GreenSTAR.</p>\n\n<p>The Mechanical Service Contractors of America, or MSCA, created the<a href=\"http://www.mscastar.org/greenstar.php\" target=\"_blank\"> GreenSTAR program </a>in response to the demand for LEED certification in commercial buildings. Taking a &ldquo;whole building&rdquo; approach like LEED, GreenSTAR contractors view buildings as an ecosystem &ndash; people, air, water, equipment, and systems all operating together to maximize environmental quality and return on investment while minimizing resource use.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\nProactive vs. reactive approach to GreenSTAR certification\n\n<p><img alt=\"HVACR Trends in Green Building with GreenStar and LEEDS - MSCA GreenStar logo - Parker Hannifin\" src=\"https://cdn.app.compendium.com/uploads/user/a862d463-3ea6-443a-9187-e1040e91eb0e/b2ef3c7e-e21d-428c-8521-33730bc6d466/Image/522a40fe3f034b54b044761d1466d549/msca_greenstar_logo.jpg\" style=\"width: 430px; height: 159px; margin-left: 15px; margin-right: 15px; float: left;\" />Getting GreenSTAR certified is a tangible way for HVAC industry professionals to demonstrate to clients their credibility and expertise in environmental stewardship.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>GreenSTAR Certification:&nbsp;</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>\n\t<p>Provides an opportunity to stand out from the competition and be an industry leader.&nbsp;</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p>Illustrates commitment to ongoing green building training and education.&nbsp;</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p>Demonstrates proven LEED experience.&nbsp;</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p>Highlights an understanding of equipment upgrade and energy efficiency issues.</p>\n\t</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Clients working with GreenSTAR companies benefit from reduced energy costs, improved air quality and water efficiency, greater employee productivity and satisfaction, and assurance that all federal and local environmental regulations are met.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\nGreen building is penetrating the residential world, and fast!\n\n<p>One major green home change that will impact contractors is the new standard for furnace fan efficiency ratings, effective in July of this year.

We discussed how one of the areas for potential improvement is mechanical design and how the <a href=\"https://ph.parker.com/us/en/ez-lok-seals\" target=\"_blank\">Parker EZ-Lok seal</a> is a major solution to mechanical seal failure. In this entry, we&rsquo;ll investigate a notably different type of cost-reduction opportunity &ndash; material selection &ndash; and see how Parker&rsquo;s innovative HiFluor compounds can reduce seal costs to as little as half.</p>\n\n&nbsp;\n\nCritical Environments\n\n<p>When it comes to the seal industry, the semiconductor market is well known as one where the most premium, chemical-resistant compounds are a necessity. Microelectronic manufacturing processes involve chemistries that push the limits of what elastomeric compounds can withstand in terms of both chemical aggressiveness and variety. The perfluorinated materials (FFKM) capable of withstanding these environments require intricate manufacturing processes regulated by closely-guarded trade secrets and the significant investment of resources.</p>\n\n<p>These factors drive the price of FFKM compounds to the point of being as much as 50 times the cost of any other variety. Cutting just a slice out of this cost can result in significant savings &ndash; a chance to take out a quarter or even half the pie would be advantageous indeed. Fabricators should be continually on the lookout for more cost-effective compounds that show equal performance in their pertinent operations.</p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"Semiconductor Fabs Lower Cost of Ownership with HiFluor Materials _Semiconductor Materials_Parker O-Ring &amp; Engineered Seals Division\" src=\"https://cdn.app.compendium.com/uploads/user/a862d463-3ea6-443a-9187-e1040e91eb0e/85362be2-35a8-4b7c-9d3c-53c32b4304ac/Image/740c0af0744e9afc30201ae92eb82e11/multi_colors_standing_1_shadow_x400.jpg\" style=\"margin-left: 15px; margin-right: 15px; float: left; width: 300px; height: 190px;\" />This is why Parker&rsquo;s HiFluor compounds offer an opportunity for cost savings that shouldn&rsquo;t go unnoticed.A unique hybrid of performance between FFKM and the simpler technology of fluorocarbon (FKM) elastomers, HiFluor offers the most superb chemical compatibility in the many semiconductor environments where the high temperature ratings of FFKM aren&rsquo;t necessary &ndash; and at a fraction of the cost.</p>\n\n<p>Not only can HiFluor be used where even FKM is lacking, but its performance in applications with aggressive plasma exposure is spectacular as well. This can be observed by its overall resistance to plasma-induced material degradation. However, Parker has also developed multiple formulations that display extremely low particle generation when most materials would be expected to suffer severe physical and chemical etch.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\nSolutions and Cost Savings\n\n<p>Need assistance deciphering exactly where this kind of cost-savings can be implemented? Parker O-Ring &amp; Engineering Seals Division has all the resources needed to help their customers identify opportunities to utilize HiFluor seals.</p>\n\n<p>For instance, one major semiconductor fab had several factors (other than their seals) dictating the frequency of their preventative maintenance (PM) intervals. The fab wanted to replace their seals at these intervals as a precautionary measure to limit the chance of them becoming another PM-increasing factor. However, this caused these premium FFKM seals to be a source of inflated cost. Parker engineers assisted with a process evaluation that resulted in over half the seals being replaced with cost-effective HiFluor O-rings, while the tool regions with more intense plasma exposure were reserved for the elite performance of <a href=\"https://www.parker.com/parkerimages/Parker.com/Literature/O-Ring%20Division%20Literature/ORD%205782%20(FF302-75).pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Parker&rsquo;s FF302</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Another major fab in the microelectronics industry switched from FKM to FFKM seals in their oxide etch process. The tool owner achieved the desired performance improvement, but soon began searching for less expensive options. Based on guidance from Parker engineers, he recognized the plasma resistance and low particulate generation of Parker&rsquo;s HiFluor compound, <a href=\"https://ph.parker.com/us/en/high-performance-fluroelastomers-65-durometer-o-ring-chemical-resistant-translucent-hf355-65\" target=\"_blank\">HF355</a>. After implementing this change, he retained the performance improvement, but at a fraction of the cost.</p>\n\n<p>Semiconductor tool owners understand that their aggressive processes require the most robust, expensive <a href=\"https://www.parker.com/literature/O-Ring%20Division%20Literature/ORD%205765%20Microelectronics%20Sealing%20Guide.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">FFKM seal materials</a>. The price tag on these seals is greater than those from any other compound family. Fortunately, HiFluor is a proven sealing solution that can bridge the gap and provide the same kind of high performance at a much lower cost.
