<p>MURRAY, Ky. — Dr. Ben Littlepage, associate professor and coordinator of Murray State University’s postsecondary education administration program in the College of Education and Human Services, recently returned from guest lecturing in Hungary as part of his work as a Fulbright Specialist.</p>



<p>Fulbright Specialists are a diverse group of highly-experienced, well-established faculty members and professionals who represent a wide variety of academic disciplines and professions.</p>



<p>Earlier this year, Littlepage worked with Dr. Nikolett Mihaly, assistant professor of psychology and economics at Hungary’s Szent Istvan University, during her visit to campus for a guest lecture.</p>



<p>“After Dr. Mihaly’s guest lecture, she asked to attend my on-campus night classes each week,” Littlepage said. “She found the topics we discussed in class fascinating.” </p>



<p>The pair decided to continue their work, exploring their options through the Fulbright Specialist program.</p>



<p>“We enjoyed working together and wanted to continue collaborating as professionals,” Littlepage said. “We knew our ideas well aligned with the mission of the Fulbright Specialist program, and spent the month of June creating a proposal. I also applied to be a Fulbright Specialist during this time period. The proposal was approved and my candidacy was accepted in August.” </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://msublueandgold.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Fulbright_Specialist-972x1024.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-10977" srcset="https://msublueandgold.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Fulbright_Specialist-972x1024.jpg 972w, https://msublueandgold.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Fulbright_Specialist-285x300.jpg 285w, https://msublueandgold.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Fulbright_Specialist-768x809.jpg 768w, https://msublueandgold.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Fulbright_Specialist.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 972px) 100vw, 972px" /><figcaption>Dr. Ben Littlepage, associate professor and coordinator of Murray State University’s postsecondary education administration program, recently returned from guest lecturing in Hungary as part of his work as a Fulbright Specialist.

<p>Littlepage spent two weeks at Szent Istvan University last month, providing five lectures and meeting with campus leadership and faculty members. In March 2020, Littlepage will return to offer additional lectures and review the progress made on implementing new concepts and strategies identified during the initial visit.</p>



<p>“Murray State, specifically the Hutson School of Agriculture, has a long-standing relationship with Szent Istvan University,” Littlepage said. “My participation as a Fulbright Specialist adds breadth to this existing relationship, further advancing areas for partnership. I will acquire a global awareness related to international higher education administration and strategic planning.”</p>

<p><strong>MURRAY, Ky. </strong>— Murray State University has established the Center for Economic and Entrepreneurial Development, a new initiative that will provide regional training and consulting support for small businesses, entrepreneurship and industry and explore student learning and employment opportunities through those relationships.<br></p>



<p>Located inside the Arthur J.

<p><strong>MURRAY, Ky. </strong>— Below is information regarding recent news, notes and accomplishments from</p>



<p>Murray State University for the week of Oct. 7–11.<br></p>



<p style="text-align:center">**<br></p>



<p>Murray State University was recently recognized as the most instagrammed college campus in Kentucky by AT&amp;T.<br></p>



<p>In its report on attsavings.com, the company tracked universities with more than 7,000 enrolled full-time students in the fall 2017 semester, then examined each school’s most popular hashtags. Kentucky’s most instagrammed hashtag is #murraystate.&nbsp;<br></p>



<p>Murray State social media specialist Bailey Crossley said the University has made a name for itself on social media, growing significant mindshare across its presence on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, LinkedIn and more.<br></p>



<p>“Locally and on campus, you can always feel the Racer Proud spirit tangibly,” Crossley said. “But on social media, hashtags are how you create that community. Being a school of less than 10,000 students, it can be easy to be looked over, but on social media, it’s evident that we are a force to be reckoned with.”<br></p>



<p style="text-align:center">**<br></p>



<p>The Murray State University Department of Global Languages and Theatre Arts presents “The War of the Worlds,” dramatized by Hoard E. Koch from the novel by H.G. Wells, on Oct. 25 and 26 in Lovett Auditorium.<br></p>



<p>The production will follow the same script used for CBS’ “The Mercury Theater on the Air” famously directed and performed by Orson Welles. “The War of the Worlds” caused nationwide panic among some listeners for its documentary-like portrayal of an invasion of spaceships from Mars.<br></p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://msublueandgold.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/War_of_the_Worlds-1.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-10970" srcset="https://msublueandgold.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/War_of_the_Worlds-1.jpg 1000w, https://msublueandgold.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/War_of_the_Worlds-1-300x225.jpg 300w, https://msublueandgold.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/War_of_the_Worlds-1-768x576.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><figcaption>Murray State student Katie Carmine from Bardstown, Kentucky performs as a foley artist during a rehearsal for an upcoming performance of “The War of the Worlds.” Live sound effects will be performed in front of the audience, a typical feature in old radio broadcasts, during performances later this month.</figcaption></figure>



<p>The show will be presented live in Lovett Auditorium on Oct. 25 and 26 at 7:30 p.m., and will be broadcast on Halloween on WKMS 91.3. Tickets are available for $10 at murraystatetickets.universitytickets.com or by calling 270-809-4421.<br></p>



<p style="text-align:center">**<br></p>



<p>Four Murray State University occupational safety and health (OSH) students were recently awarded scholarships from the Chevron Corporation. Murray State recipients include Logan Forsythe of Hardin, Kentucky, Jacob Littlefield of La Grange, Kentucky, Ben Schatz of Carlyle, Illinois, and Kevonte Turnley of Evansville, Indiana.&nbsp;<br></p>



<p>&#8220;We in the OSH program are very grateful for the annual commitment made by the Chevron Corporation in providing support to students in the form of scholarships, mentored internships and a generous donation to the program,&#8221; said Dr. Tracey Wortham, Murray State Department of Occupational Safety and Health chair. &#8220;We appreciate the importance Chevron places on developing the next generation of safety and health professionals.&#8221;<br></p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://msublueandgold.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/OSH-1.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-10971" srcset="https://msublueandgold.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/OSH-1.jpg 1000w, https://msublueandgold.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/OSH-1-300x172.jpg 300w, https://msublueandgold.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/OSH-1-768x441.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><figcaption>Four Murray State University occupational safety and health (OSH) students were awarded scholarships from the Chevron Corporation.

Representing Chevron are OSH alumni Alicia Mathis (left), Mollie Baxley (right), and Kyle Craig (back right). Not shown are scholarship recipients Logan Forsythe and Ben Schatz.</figcaption></figure>



<p>The Department of Occupational Safety and Health at Murray State University provides a comprehensive, broad-based educational background designed to prepare academically sound graduates with practical experience for positions in the occupational safety, health, and environmental profession.<br></p>



<p style="text-align:center">**<br></p>



<p>Assistant professor of archaeology Dr. Marcie Venter was recently appointed to the Kentucky Native American Heritage Commission.<br></p>



<p>Established in 1996, the Commission’s mission is to recognize and promote Native American contributions and influence in Kentucky’s history and culture. The commission has 17 members, eight of whom are required to be of Native American heritage. The commission also includes representatives from institutions of higher learning, archaeology, Native American arts and the public.<br></p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m honored and humbled by the appointment and look forward to working with and on behalf of the native community as we promote and preserve their many contributions to Kentucky&#8217;s heritage and current character,” Venter said. “As an anthropological archaeologist, active researcher and educator who has worked with different native groups over my career in both the U.S. and international contexts, I am well-positioned to speak to both the shared and internally distinct historic and modern concerns of the community and highlight their voices.&nbsp;<br></p>



<p>“Within the commonwealth, native contributions aren&#8217;t given nearly the attention they&#8217;re deserved or else they are perceived as relevant to only our distant past. The Commission is actively working to change that misconception.&#8221;<br></p>



<p>Venter’s term is for three years, until Sept. 1, 2023.<br></p>

<h4><strong><em>More than 500 students, faculty, staff and alumni take part in professional attire sale</em></strong></h4>



<p><strong>MURRAY, Ky. </strong>— Murray State University students, families, faculty, staff and alumni filled JCPenney’s Murray location Sep. 29 for the latest JCPenney Suit-Up event.<br></p>



<p>From 4 to 9 p.m. that day, members of the Racer community could stop by and take an extra 60 percent off men and women’s dress apparel and shoes.<br></p>



<p>A total of 501 people visited JCPenney for the sale, marking a 17 percent increase compared to the spring event.&nbsp;<br></p>



<p>“We were so excited to help more students find professional clothing at a greatly discounted rate, and JCPenney was great to work with once again,” said Career Services intern Emily Perry. “We plan to have another Suit-Up event in spring 2020.”<br></p>



<p>To prepare for the sale, Career Services staff spent time training with JCPenney associates on how to measure clients for shirts, jackets and more. University representatives volunteered their time during the event, while JCPenney associates worked after hours to ensure that students had a positive experience.<br></p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://msublueandgold.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Suit_Up.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-10959" srcset="https://msublueandgold.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Suit_Up.jpg 1000w, https://msublueandgold.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Suit_Up-300x200.jpg 300w, https://msublueandgold.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Suit_Up-768x512.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></figure>



<p>&#8220;We were thrilled at how well the Suit-Up Event was received by not only students, but faculty, staff and alumni,” said Director of Career Services Matt Purdy. “We couldn&#8217;t ask for better partners for this sort of event other than JCPenney. I heard from multiple people that evening and afterward, and the biggest complaint I got was about how full the parking lot was. What a great problem to have.”<br></p>



<p>The next Suit-Up event is set for Feb. 16 from 4 to 9 p.m.<br></p>



<p>Career Services also offers a Career Closet that provides donated professional attire for students.&nbsp;<br></p>



<p>The Career Closet features various sizes of gently-used business professional clothing. Racers have the opportunity to come in and shop for suits, shirts, skirts, blouses, shoes and other accessories — all free of charge. One outfit is limited per student per semester.&nbsp;<br></p>



<p>Visit Career Services in room 100 of the Oakley Applied Science Building between 8 a.m. and 4:30 p.m. to check out the closet. For more information, contact Career Services at 270-809-3735.<br></p>

<p><strong>MURRAY, Ky. </strong>— Murray State University held its first-ever Faculty Appreciation Festival Oct. 1 at Pogue Library, honoring University faculty for their commitment to student success.<br></p>



<p>Organized by five faculty members serving as fellows in the Bluegrass Academic Leadership Academy (BALA), an initiative of the Bluegrass Higher Education Consortium, the event honored newly-tenured and promoted faculty with an evening of refreshments and conversation.<br></p>



<p>The festival was organized by Faculty Regent Dr. Melony Shemberger, Department of Educational Studies, Leadership and Counseling chair Dr. Susana Bloomdahl, School of Nursing and Health Professions interim dean Dr. Dina Byers, Jesse D. Jones College of Science, Engineering and Technology assistant dean Dr. Maeve McCarthy and Department of Political Science and Sociology interim chair Dr. Drew Seib.<br></p>



<p>The five fellows will discuss the festival project as a presentation at the next BALA meeting, set for Oct. 18 at Kentucky State University. As part of the year-long fellowship, the group was tasked to identify a specific campus need and execute a project to address it.&nbsp;<br></p>

<p>&#8220;The Faculty Appreciation Festival involved months of planning,” Shemberger said. “The five of us are extremely busy in our roles at Murray State, but we wanted to have a program centered on faculty recognition, as this was a need we identified as a high priority. We are extremely pleased with how this event evolved, and the faculty response to it was positive.<br></p>



<p>“We are grateful to former Provost Dr. Mark Arant and Interim Provost Dr. Tim Todd for their encouragement and support of this project. We could not have done this without them.”<br></p>



<p>Shemberger added that more than 80 faculty members attended the festival.<br></p>



<p>&#8220;Personally, I am thankful to have worked with the other fellows,” Shemberger said. “We had a lot of fun networking and getting to know each other better. We worked hard and successfully as a team. I am honored to have been a part of this.&#8221;<br></p>

<p><strong>MURRAY, Ky. </strong>— Murray State proudly presents the fifth annual “Swingin’ Memories” Homecoming dance on Friday, Oct. 18, featuring the award-winning Murray State University Jazz Orchestra and Jazz Band. The event will take place in the Brightside Room of Tap 216 at the corner of Olive Boulevard and 15th Street in Murray, Kentucky. The two twenty-member ensembles are under the direction of Dr. Todd E. Hill, professor of music.<br></p>



<p>The Jazz Orchestra and Jazz Band will feature swing tunes from the 1930s and 40s as well as some later hits up through the 1960s. Music featured will include hits made famous by Benny Goodman, Duke Ellington, Tommy Dorsey, Les Brown, Count Basie and many others. The two groups will play from 8–10:30 p.m.<br></p>



<p>&#8220;This is such a terrific opportunity for these music students,&#8221; said Hill, a longtime professional bandleader whose professional band has been playing dances for over 35 years. &#8220;They get to experience playing for dancers, and the basis of all jazz is that it should have a danceable beat, so what better way to feel the give and take that motion brings to the music? Those who don’t care to dance are more than welcome to just come, listen and enjoy the music.”&nbsp;<br></p>

<p>Tunes used by many of the Murray State dance bands from the swing period will be featured, including those led by Billy Shelton, Len Foster, Jim Fern, Leroy Offerman, Billy Crosswy, the Phi Mu Alpha &#8220;Men of Note&#8221; bands and regional favorites like Jack Staulcup, Tom Lonardo and Chuck Simons.&nbsp;<br></p>



<p>The admission fee is $10 for adults and $5 for students. Further donations are welcome. All profits will go toward the Murray State jazz program.<br></p>



<p>During Hill’s tenure, the Murray State Jazz Orchestra has won auditions at the prestigious Midwest International Band and Orchestra Clinic, performed four times for the Kentucky Music Educators Association Conference and for the fourth time, they will appear at the nation&#8217;s oldest event of its kind: the Elmhurst College Jazz Festival (also in Chicago) this February. They presently have four albums in release, one of which qualified for Grammy nomination. <br></p>

<p><strong>MURRAY, Ky. </strong>— The Murray State University Department of Art &amp; Design welcomes Terry McKelvey, a painter and professor of art at Edinboro University, for a lecture on his work and studio visits with advanced painting students. The lecture will be held in the Price Doyle Fine Arts Center room 631 at 5 p.m. on Monday, Oct. 14, and is free and open to the public.<br></p>



<p>Terry McKelvey was born in Bridgeport, Connecticut, and grew up in New England. He earned a Bachelor of Fine Arts in painting from the Maine College of Art (formerly the Portland School of Art) and a Master of Fine Arts from Cornell University. He is currently a professor of art at Edinboro University in Pennsylvania, where he has taught painting, drawing, 2D foundations and graduate coursework since 1998.<br></p>



<p>McKelvey is an observation-based painter whose subject matter includes traditional genres such as still life, landscape, self-portrait and figure. He also creates figure-based psychological narrative paintings that relate to universal themes, such as inter-personal relationships, sex, death and the afterlife. McKelvey frequently portrays himself as a protagonist within these works.<br></p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://msublueandgold.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/McKelvey.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-10946" srcset="https://msublueandgold.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/McKelvey.jpg 500w, https://msublueandgold.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/McKelvey-250x300.jpg 250w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /><figcaption>The Murray State University Department of Art &amp; Design welcomes Terry McKelvey, a painter and professor of art at Edinboro University, for a lecture on his work and studio visits with advanced painting students. Pictured is a sample of his work.</figcaption></figure>



<p>McKelvey has just completed a month-long painting residency at Soaring Gardens in rural northeastern Pennsylvania, and was recently selected for a small group exhibition at Manifest Gallery in Cincinnati. His most recent solo exhibition was last year at Thiel College in Greenville, Pennsylvania. McKelvey’s paintings were also featured in “Assembled Visions,” an exhibition of four Edinboro faculty, at the Erie Art Museum in 2016. He recently curated a group exhibition that featured paintings by Edinboro alumni and students, at the Crary Art Gallery in Warren, Pennsylvania.&nbsp;<br></p>
