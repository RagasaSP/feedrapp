Several studies\nhave found that PEA directly activates two different&nbsp;nonclassical\ncannabinoid receptors.<sup>7</sup> </p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Effect of PEA on the endocannabinoid system</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Initially, PEA was believed to be an agonist of the type 2\ncannabinoid receptor (CB2), which is present throughout the immune system.<sup>2,8</sup>\nBut it has since been discovered that PEA cannot bind to the known cannabinoid\nreceptors.<sup>2</sup> </p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, it is possible that PEA indirectly activates\nCB2, as well as the type 1 cannabinoid receptor (CB1) found in the central\nnervous system, due to the endocannabinoid system’s “entourage effect.”<sup>3,7-9</sup>\nThe entourage effect was first proposed as a theory to explain why single\ncomponents of botanical substances such as cannabis were not as effective as\nthe entire botanical.<sup>9 </sup>According to the entourage effect theory, certain\ninactive metabolites and closely related molecules significantly increase the\nactivity of some cannabinoids on the body’s endocannabinoid system (ECS),<sup>9</sup>\nwhich controls and regulates many physiological functions in our bodies.<sup>10</sup>\n</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One way in which PEA can\nindirectly activate CB1 and CB2 receptors is by inhibiting the expression of\nfatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH), an enzyme that degrades the CB1 agonist AEA.<sup>3,7</sup>\nThe transient receptor potential vanilloid receptor type 1 (TRPV1) channels,\nwhich are also endocannabinoid targets, can also be indirectly activated by\nPEA.<sup>7</sup> From these activities, it can be surmised that PEA needs synergistic\nactions among several mechanisms for it to be able to produce its effects.<sup>7</sup></p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>As mentioned earlier, the beneficial\nproperties of PEA have been recognized since the 1950s. Clinical trials\nconducted since 1970 have demonstrated PEA’s immune-modulating capabilities.<sup>4</sup>\n</p>\n\n\n\n<p>PEA is involved in a number of metabolic functions in the body, as well as in maintaining a balance of factors that keep cells healthy.<sup>4</sup></p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"smaller\"><strong>References</strong>:</p>\n\n\n\n<ol class=\"smaller\"><li>Beggiato S et al. <em>Front Pharmacol</em>. 2019;10:821.</li><li>PubChem, U.S. National Library of Medicine, National Center for Biotechnology Information. <a href=\"https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/4671\">https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/4671</a>.

Carbs, or carbohydrates, are macronutrients that provide 4 calories per gram and have long been a part of the human diet.<sup>1,2,3&nbsp;</sup>However, following certain emerging dietary trends, such as keto and Paleo, requires removing a majority of carbohydrates from the diet. Whether you “love ’em”or “leave ’em,” it is important to understand how these macronutrients are listed on food labels in order to make the choices that best fit into your own lifestyle. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>What are net carbs?</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Not all carbs are processed in the body the same way. Some carbs have a reduced or no caloric value. This is true for fiber. Other carbs are sugar alcohols and are digested in a different way and thus have a different caloric value and affect blood sugar differently from other sugars.<sup>2</sup> With this in mind, some companies selling low-carbohydrate foods have chosen to describe the carbohydrate content with the term “net carbs”—a term not yet officially defined—to describe the quantity of carbohydrate after subtracting fiber and sugar alcohols.<sup>4 </sup>The idea of net carbs is to identify the net impact that carbohydrates have on the body. However, because the concept of “net carbs” is not a term defined, or regulated, by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), this term is not reliable. What is important is to understand the various types of carbohydrates in your diet and how they differ from one another.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Carbs are plentiful in foods such as baked goods, sugary foods, breads, grains, fruits, and starchy vegetables. While it would be beneficial for almost everyone to remove carb-heavy foods like pastries, soda, and candy from their diet, other carbs that come from whole grains, fruits, and vegetables are important to a well-rounded diet. One of the reasons those types of foods are beneficial is that they provide indigestible fiber, which also helps to provide support for intestinal mobility and removal of waste from the body.<sup>5</sup> Additionally, insoluble fiber, such as that found in bran, has essentially no caloric value because it is not digestible. Soluble fiber does get partially absorbed and provides about 2 calories per gram, instead of 4 calories, as found in other carbohydrates.<sup>1 </sup></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Indigestible fibers support the healthy functioning of the body. Insoluble fiber helps move waste through the intestine, often referred to as laxation. This helps prevent <a href=\"https://blog.metagenics.com/post/2018/10/12/common-causes-of-constipation-and-solutions-to-help/\">occasional constipation</a>,<sup>5</sup>&nbsp;which may be a problem with a low-carbohydrate lifestyle. On the other hand, soluble fiber swells up after consumption and provides cushioning in the intestine and also helps to bind unwanted components and cholesterol.<sup>6,7</sup> Soluble fiber also may act as a prebiotic, supporting the growth of healthful bacteria in the intestine.<sup>8</sup> The combination of insoluble and soluble fiber are two key components in helping the intestine to be functional.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Breaking down net carbs</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>For those counting carbs, reading labels is a way of life. It’s important to remember that when carbohydrates are listed on a label, they include the starchy and sugary carbs as well as fiber, so look for foods that provide fiber without high levels of sugars and starch. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>A new development in food labeling regulations is that the FDA has redefined what specific ingredients can be listed as dietary fiber based on what the FDA has determined can be supported by specific, scientifically substantiated health benefits.<sup>9</sup> While there is the possibility for other fibers to be added in the future, there are now indigestible fibers that would not be identified on the label as fiber if they were not on the FDA’s approved list, which makes the concept of net carbs even more difficult to justify.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p style=\"font-size:70%;\"><strong>References</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"font-size:70%;\"><ol><li>Slavin J et al.

That growth has spurned new\nvariations, such as the <a href=\"https://blog.metagenics.com/post/2019/01/07/clean-vs-dirty-keto/\">“dirty keto” diet</a>, while illuminating\npotential nutritional deficiencies that must be addressed.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>A closer look at dirty keto</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Dirty\nketo follows the same macronutrient breakdown of fats, protein, and carbs as\nclean keto, except for one major difference: It doesn’t matter which foods\nthose macros come from. So instead of choosing good, healthy fats like\nwild-caught salmon, grass-fed butter, and avocado, you eat a fast food burger\n(without the bun), processed cheese, and pork rinds. Will you lose weight by\nfollowing the dirty keto diet? Yes. But there are remarkable health drawbacks\nyou should be aware of, too—namely, the dirty keto diet is missing vital\nmicronutrients like vitamins, minerals, and enzymes that are necessary to your\noverall health. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Furthermore, processed foods are usually high in sodium,\nwhich can lead to bloating and other GI discomfort.<sup>3</sup> In my clinical practice, I’ve seen patients both regain\nthe weight they’ve lost and experience more\ncravings and less satiety. Dirty keto foods can trigger these cravings and\nfeelings of food withdrawal, leading to what’s known as the <a href=\"https://blog.metagenics.com/post/2018/07/30/the-lowdown-on-the-ketogenic-diet-part-2/\">keto flu</a>.<sup>5</sup></p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Common nutritional deficiencies on the keto diet</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Overall, choosing the clean keto diet is the better route if you want to minimize these undesirable side effects. However, even the clean keto diet may result in vitamin and nutrient deficiencies. Here are some common ones—and some diet based options that are available to support them.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Magnesium</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Magnesium is an essential mineral that plays a critical role in human biochemistry and general health. Present in all cells of the body, magnesium serves as an enzyme cofactor in more than 300 biochemical reactions, including protein synthesis, muscle and nerve function, blood glucose maintenance, and blood pressure regulation.<sup>5</sup> Magnesium is also necessary for glycolysis, which is the first step in converting carbohydrates into energy—playing a highly important role in the body’s ability to maintain healthy energy levels.<sup>6</sup> In addition, magnesium contributes to the structural bone development and is necessary for the synthesis of DNA, RNA, and glutathione.<sup>6</sup> It also plays a role in the active transport of calcium and potassium ions across cell membranes, critical to nerve impulse conduction, muscle contraction, neurological health, and cardiac function.<sup>6</sup> </p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Fiber</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://blog.metagenics.com/post/2018/10/29/adding-fiber-to-a-ketogenic-diet/\">Fiber</a> is paramount to our digestive health. As\na type of carbohydrate, however, fiber is unsurprisingly scant in the diet of\nsomeone on keto. In this case, adding fiber through leafy green vegetables may\nbe a good idea.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Iron</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Without iron, our cells cannot get\noxygen. Iron is also responsible for hemoglobin formation and improving blood\nquality.<sup>7</sup> Many people struggle to\nconsume adequate amounts of iron in their standard diets. Iron-rich foods such\nas red meat, legumes, quinoa, turkey, and others may help avoid running low on\nthis key micronutrient.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Zinc</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Zinc is involved in many aspects of cellular metabolism, it supports normal growth and development.<sup>8</sup> Zinc can be found naturally in poultry, fish, and red meat.  </p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Electrolytes</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Electrolytes\nare substances that are utilized by the body to create electrically charged\nfluids. Many bodily functions depend on electrolytes, especially in muscle and\nnervous system tissue. Major electrolytes found in the body include sodium,\nchloride, potassium, magnesium, calcium, phosphate, and bicarbonate. Some\nwhole-food options to increase electrolytes are spinach, bananas, prunes,\nbroccoli, and oranges.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Thiamin and folate</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>B vitamins—such as thiamin, folate, and a\nnumber of others—are indispensable for the body’s energy supply and for the\noptimal functioning of the muscles and nervous system.<sup>9</sup> This group of water-soluble vitamins also stimulates the production of\nneurotransmitters.<sup>9</sup> When you consume a low-carb\ndiet such as keto, you might experience a deficiency in thiamin and\nfolate.<sup>9</sup> </p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Vitamin C</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Vitamin C promotes proper functioning of\nneurotransmitters and protects our cells from damage.<sup>10</sup> Vitamin C is also needed for building connective&nbsp;tissue and\npromoting resistance to infection.<sup>10 </sup>A variety of low-carb foods contain vitamin C, including kale, bell\npeppers, broccoli, Brussels sprouts, as well as most fruits.&nbsp; </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Compared to the <a href=\"https://blog.metagenics.com/post/2017/07/14/is-the-standard-american-diet-more-sad-than-we-realize/\">Standard American Diet</a>, the keto diet is\nnot only safe for helping overweight people lose weight, recent studies have\nalso demonstrated a variety of health benefits that don’t include just weight\nloss.<sup>11,12</sup> However,\nfollowers of the keto diet should be prepared to address possible vitamin and\nnutrient deficiencies—namely, deficiencies in magnesium, fiber, iron, zinc,\nelectrolytes, thiamin, folate, and vitamin C. To maintain healthy levels of\nthese vital nutrients, consult your Functional Medicine practitioner to\nascertain the appropriate dietary changes that suit your individual health\nneeds.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Dr. Silverman is a\npaid consultant and guest writer for Metagenics.</em> </p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"smaller\"><strong>References:</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ol class=\"smaller\"><li>Volek JS et al. <em>Nutr Met. </em>2004;1:13.</li><li><em>JAMA</em>. 2018;319(3):215-217. </li><li>Haidong Zhu et al. <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3934330/\">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3934330</a>. 2014;133(3):e635–e642.
