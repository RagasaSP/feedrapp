Substituting your child&#8217;s name in &#8220;<em>Mary</em> Had a Little Lamb&#8221; or singing &#8220;This little <em>Lauren</em> of mine&#8221; (instead of <em>&#8220;light&#8221;</em>) can be so powerful in getting or redirecting their attention.

Changes in routine often benefit from pre-planning and practice.</p>\n<div class=\"mobile-only\" align=\"center\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-1414 alignleft\" src=\"https://www.musictogether.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/mom-walking-kids-small.jpg\" alt=\"mom walking children to school\" width=\"auto\" height=\"200\" /></div>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.zerotothree.org/resources/78-preschool-prep-how-to-prepare-your-toddler-for-preschool\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Zero to Three</a> and <a href=\"https://www.pbs.org/parents/thrive/helping-preschoolers-cope-with-separation-anxiety\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">PBS Kids</a> both have great articles on this topic. It&#8217;s likely that your child&#8217;s preschool teacher will use songs and chants to manage the classroom flow from one activity to another. Transition songs are wonderful &#8220;tools&#8221; in a teacher&#8217;s toolbox! Songs and chants convey information that can be repeated many times while retaining excitement and beauty. Singing a song about cleaning up is much more interesting than hearing (or saying!) &#8220;It&#8217;s time to clean up.&#8221;</p>\n<h2>Before Preschool Starts</h2>\n<p>Songs and chants can decrease the stress of the transition from home to school, too. If your little one is nervous about going to school, singing a few songs about school can encourage excitement about the new things they will experience. You might change the words to a well-known song to include verses about playing with new friends, learning new things, or having a snack or lunch. For instance, you might try singing these verses to the tune of &#8220;She&#8217;ll be Comin&#8217; &#8216;Round the Mountain&#8221;:</p>\n<p style=\"margin-left: 30px;\">I am going to my preschool today,<br />\nI am going to my preschool today,<br />\nI am going to my preschool,<em> *I&#8217;m gonna play with friends,*</em><br />\nI am going to my preschool today!</p>\n<p>You can change the words &#8220;I&#8217;m gonna play with friends&#8221; to any number of typical preschool experiences. Try replacing the phrase &#8220;play with friends&#8221; with &#8220;sit in circle,&#8221; &#8220;draw a picture,&#8221; &#8220;learn my letters,&#8221; or even simply &#8220;have a good time.&#8221;</p>\n<h2>Reassurances</h2>\n<p>Your preschooler may need extra reassurance that you (or someone they love and trust) will return at the end of the day. If you do not already have a song in your family repertoire that addresses this concern, consider the Music Together song &#8220;They Come Back.&#8221; This little tune combines a question-and-answer construction with a bit of humor to help young children articulate their feelings. If you are not a confident singer, consider singing along with the recording. Use exaggerated facial expressions and hugs to help communicate the idea that a reunion is only a few hours away. A free download of the song is available <a href=\"/they-come-back\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">here</a>.</p>\n<h2>After School</h2>\n<p>The period of time after school is another transition. If your child struggles to transition from school to home, consider using the same song, &#8220;She&#8217;ll Be Comin&#8217; &#8216;Round the Mountain,&#8221; with new words to help your child reflect on the events of the day.</p>\n<p style=\"margin-left: 30px;\">I went to my preschool today,<br />\nI went to my preschool today,<br />\nI went to my preschool and *<em>we played outside</em>,*<br />\nI went to my preschool today!</p>\n<p>You can extend this sharing time by asking your child questions about their experience to get more detail: &#8220;What activity center did you choose first?&#8221; &#8220;Who did you play with when you played outside?&#8221; &#8220;Which activity was your favorite today?&#8221; &#8220;What was the most exciting thing that happened today?&#8221; Sing a new verse for each of their answers or just make up silly verses, and enjoy the time you spend with your child.</p>\n<h2>Songs Convey Emotion</h2>\n<p>The idea behind using songs in this way comes from what we know about music&#8217;s ability to communicate emotions. The melodic contour of a song (the way notes of the song move up and down to create the recognizable tune) and predictable rhythm (the divisions of the song&#8217;s pulse) provide developing brains with the necessary multi-sensory input to organize and process information, including information about emotion.</p>\n<p>Some of the factors that influence how a person perceives the emotional component of a song include the following: familiarity with the particular song, familiarity with the singer&#8217;s voice or the rendition of the song, current emotional state, and culture. For a particularly good review of the neuroscience of children&#8217;s development, including how rhythm impacts this in positive ways, please review this talk by <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IHFWUVaj4g\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Dr. Laurel Trainor</a> given at the Kennedy Center.</p>\n<p>There is no single &#8220;right&#8221; song to help your child through transitions, so having a selection at your fingertips can be very helpful! &#8220;She&#8217;ll Be Comin&#8217; &#8216;Round the Mountain,&#8221; may be familiar to some families, but others may be more familiar with &#8220;Hiné Ma Tov&#8221; or &#8220;Obwisana.&#8221; Choose a song that works for your family and make it your own. You will build a new tradition that will serve you through a variety of transitions.</p>\n<p>And, don&#8217;t worry about making &#8220;mistakes&#8221;—as you sing, your child hears that you love them.</p>\n<p><strong>Author:</strong><br />\nCarol Ann Blank, Ph.D., LCAT, LPC, MT-BC, Manager of Research and Special Needs Services, Music Together LLC</p>\n",

However, none are <em>quite</em> so invested as Sara Keene (not her real name), who has continuously attended classes for thirteen years—and counting.</p>\n<div class=\"mobile-only\" align=\"center\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-1414 alignleft\" src=\"https://www.musictogether.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/SongCollectionsGraphics-Flute-web-e1563207212627.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" /></div>\n<p>Sara discovered Music Together in 2006, when a friend recommended it to her after the birth of her first child. “I immediately thought that this program would be very stimulating for the development of my child, and also a great opportunity to have an activity to meet other mothers with children,” Sara recalls. Little did she know that Music Together would become an activity that she would continue to love for so many years, or that her household would blossom into a family of six—three boys and three girls! Over the years, she has enrolled all of her children in mixed-age classes from the time they were born through age four, with her youngest children still in attendance.</p>\n<p>Sara goes to every class with her children, typically enrolling two siblings at a time. She enjoys the camaraderie that builds within the playful, safe environs of the class community. She also believes that the program has greatly enhanced her children’s interest in continuing to make music. “When the older children were young, they had a lot of fun ‘replaying’ the Music Together classes at home,” she says. “All my children have expressed an interest in learning to play instruments, and some have developed a real passion for it. Developing a passion for something is the most important thing of all for me.”</p>\n<p>By now, Sara and her children are quite familiar with the Music Together collections; over the years they have enjoyed singing the songs at home, in the car, and as they go about their daily activities. The tunes have become a part of the children’s lives, with the older siblings passing on their favorites to the younger ones. And with so many songs to choose from, the music never gets old for this family. “We love all the songs, but in every collection we find ones that become our favorites. And when there are new songs that come out, that is always very entertaining!” remarks Sara. A few they especially like are “A Ram Sam Sam,” “All Around the Kitchen,” and “Dancing with Teddy.”</p>\n<p>Soon, Sara will be making even <em>more</em> Music Together memories with the new baby she is expecting! She looks forward to continuing to share the wonder of music with her children as they learn and grow with Music Together. “Music…was the first language that my children learned,” says Sara. “And because all my children attended Music Together, we all ‘speak’ that same language. The songs are a lasting memory for everyone.”</p>\n",
