Your goal is to find people in the world, recruit them, make them join your team, and then play as those characters to fight the fight oppression.</p>\n<p><strong>GAME</strong>: And how did the idea for this sequel come about? </p>\n<p><strong>Sean Crooks</strong>: So, with Watch Dogs, we always had the profiler, which has always been a very interesting way to explore people. But, with Watch Dogs Legion we thought &#8216;what if that was accurate?&#8217;, as in fully simulated. So we explored that idea. And that led us where we are now with the play as anyone innovation. Literally any person you profile in the world can be playable. If you look at that profile, there&#8217;s a full schedule attached to it. So if that person says, they work at a certain place, they will go to that place and they will be working there. If they have a meeting at a certain time or a lunch event, they will literally go through the world and have a lunch at that time. And the person that they meeting, if you look at that life in their schedule, they&#8217;ll be scheduled to meet that person at that time, at that place for lunch. It&#8217;s an extremely crazy and deep system that literally brings the promise of the Watch Dogs profiler to life.</p>\n</div><img  class=\"x-img x-img-none\"  src=\"https://news.game.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Watch-Dogs-Legion-Recruitment.jpg\" ><div  class=\"x-text\"    ><p><strong>GAME</strong>: You can recruit anyone to join DedSec. Let’s say I see someone walking past on the street, how do I recruit them?</p>\n<p><strong>Sean Crooks: </strong>The first thing is that you want to know whether you want to, right? [Maybe] they look cool or if you profile them, they have a really cool trait. In Watch Dogs Legion we have traits, which are gameplay bonuses that you can look for that might help you resolve a situation. So say, you have a problem with a drone. You’ll need a guy who&#8217;s good with drones. So you scoured around the world to find this guy, profile him, and you&#8217;ll see when you look at his schedule, how much he&#8217;s aligned with DedSec. He could be super happy with them or he might not be. </p>\n<p>So what you then need to do is look into his life, look into his problems, and start fixing those problems. Maybe has a debt with a loan shark or maybe has a problem with a crime gang. If you fix that problem, he&#8217;ll come to love DedSec, then you&#8217;ll finally get an origin mission [to complete], and then he&#8217;ll join your team.</p>\n<p><strong>GAME:</strong> How do those origin missions come about? What&#8217;s the process behind how they’re generated?</p>\n<p><strong>Sean Crooks:</strong> So that system is massively systemic, it can be cast in many different locations in the world. It&#8217;s literally dynamically built from what&#8217;s happening around you &#8211; from the characters to where you are physically, all of that kind of combines into it choosing the schedule.</p>\n<p><strong>GAME: </strong>How did you begin to design characters when every single one is playable? </p>\n<p><strong>Sean Crooks:</strong> The starting point is to go around to London and look at the people &#8211; like the cultures, the areas, the different locations and boroughs of London. What are the characters like in real life? We flew to those areas, we looked at it and studied the fashion and the different people in those areas. And then we said what if you know, this was a near future London, so then we added that spice on top, and that&#8217;s how we developed the fashion and the characters that populate Watch Dogs Legion.</p>\n</div><img  class=\"x-img x-img-none\"  src=\"https://news.game.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Watch-Dogs-Legion-Spider-Bot.jpg\" ><div  class=\"x-text\"    ><p><strong>GAME:</strong> What was it about London that was that was attractive to you?<br />\n<strong><br />\nSean Crooks:</strong> London is one of the most surveilled cities in the world, which is something we love in the Watch Dogs universe. On top of that, you have the contrast between history and modern architecture, the variety and diversity of its people. All of these combined to make it just an amazing playground to experience and to fight a resistance in. </p>\n<p><strong>GAME: </strong>How did you go about trying to create that feel of London?</p>\n<p><strong>Sean Crooks:</strong> So what we did, very early on, we had a team of people go to London and do an extremely in-depth dive [into the city]. We met with local businesses, and in each of the different boroughs, we studied little elements and parts of London. We even met with crime gangs, we studied that in depth. And then that was the starting point. Once we had all of this interesting information of snippets of local cultures, then we sent a big team down on the ground. So we spent weeks in London, photographing, experiencing all the boroughs, recording ambient audios. And then we bring all of that back and then we start work on actually recreating that in Watch Dogs Legion.</p>\n</div><img  class=\"x-img x-img-none\"  src=\"https://news.game.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Watch-Dogs-Legion-crew.jpg\" ><div  class=\"x-text\"    ><p><strong>GAME:</strong> From what we&#8217;ve seen of the gameplay so far, you can choose how to approach missions depending on the character you&#8217;re playing as. Do you have a preferred playstyle?</p>\n<p><strong>Sean Crooks:</strong> So the one really cool new feature in Watch Dogs Legion is that you can play [as one of three] classes. So when you recruit a character into your team, you can choose the class type you want to be. So you have the Enforcer, which is the guy who walks in the front with heavy weapons, you know the type of character who can carry those and support those. They also have a special ability which is throwing a less-than-lethal shock device that can stick and explode. </p>\n<p>You can also have the Infiltrator. The Infiltrator is more your stealth character, and they have the ability to hack the augmented reality devices of the bad guys to make you invisible. They also have very competent melee skills, and melee is a new mechanic we&#8217;ve added to Watch Dogs Legion. With melee, when they fight, they don&#8217;t propagate the experience around the whole layout, so you can just deal with the small pockets of guys. </p>\n<p>Lastly, you have the Hacker, which is my favorite! The Hacker has the ability to launch this little stealthy spider bot that can run around layouts and be deployed into a little automated mini-turret that can take out the bad guys. Hackers can also hack every single drone and control them in the world including CT drones that have rocket fires and machine guns, so it&#8217;s pretty cool</p>\n</div><img  class=\"x-img x-img-none\"  src=\"https://news.game.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Watch-Dogs-Legion-Big-Kicks.jpg\" ><div  class=\"x-text\"    ><p><strong>GAME:</strong> In terms of the melee, how has it changed for Watch Dogs Legion?</p>\n<p><strong>Sean Crooks: </strong>It&#8217;s an entirely new system. We never had a you know, in the past it was always a takedown based system but now it&#8217;s a full melee system. You can have grapples, punches and each character and each personality of character has unique take downs. An MI5 agent can do tactical take downs. You know, as you saw in our amazing E3 assets you saw the granny&#8217;s taser take downs there so every single character and the people you recruit from the world it actually changes the feeling of how you do your melee.</p>\n<p><strong>GAME:</strong> Speaking of the E3 demo, we also saw Permadeath. How did you arrive at that idea and how does it change the way the game feels?<br />\n<strong><br />\nSean Crooks: </strong>So, for us, in Watch Dogs Legion, it was important that we made you care about your characters. We want them to be important to you, we wanted to introduce risk and reward with that. So, when you go down for the first time when your health is drained, you get an option &#8211; you can choose to resist or you can choose to surrender. If you surrender you&#8217;re arrested and then your character&#8217;s unavailable for a time. You can technically go and do some hacks and expose a police station and get your guy out though, but that’s a separate topic! </p>\n<p>Or, if you choose to resist, you can get up and fight again. But if you do that, you know you&#8217;re risking the permanent death of your operative.</p>\n<p><strong>GAME:</strong> One final question. What&#8217;s the best character you&#8217;ve seen so far?</p>\n<p><strong>Sean Crooks:</strong> I think the internet would kill me if I didn&#8217;t say Helen. I think I have no choice. She is she&#8217;s she&#8217;s a celebrity in her own right now. We all love Helen.</p>\n</div><img  class=\"x-img x-img-none\"  src=\"https://news.game.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Watch-Dogs-Legion-Helen-Zapping.jpg\" ><div  class=\"x-text\"    ><p><em><a href=\"https://www.game.co.uk/en/games/watch-dogs/watch-dogs-legion/?cm_sp=GAMEMedia-_-WatchDogsLegionInterview-_-WDL\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Watch Dogs Legion launches on 6 March and you can pre-order it here.</a> And if you want the latest news, features, and deals from GAME, <a href=\"https://my.game.co.uk/preferences\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">sign up to our newsletter today!</a></em></p>\n</div><div  class=\"x-recent-posts cf horizontal\"  data-x-element=\"recent_posts\" data-x-params=\"{&quot;fade&quot;:false}\" data-fade=\"false\" ><a class=\"x-recent-post2 with-image\" href=\"https://news.game.co.uk/death-stranding-everything-you-need-to-know/\" title=\"Permalink to: &quot;Everything you need to know about Death Stranding&quot;\"><article id=\"post-11421\" class=\"post-11421 post type-post status-publish format-standard has-post-thumbnail hentry category-carousel-content category-featurednews category-features category-home category-news tag-death-stranding tag-everything tag-everything-you-need-to-know tag-guide tag-hideo-kojima tag-playstation-4 tag-ps4\"><div class=\"entry-wrap\"><div class=\"x-recent-posts-img\" style=\"background-image: url(https://news.game.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/death-stranding-everything-we-know-cargo-1184x662.jpg);\"></div><div class=\"x-recent-posts-content\"><h3 class=\"h-recent-posts\">Everything you need to know about Death Stranding</h3><span class=\"x-recent-posts-date\">18th October 2019</span></div></div></article></a><a class=\"x-recent-post2 with-image\" href=\"https://news.game.co.uk/relaxing-games/\" title=\"Permalink to: &quot;6 relaxing games to help you chill out&quot;\"><article id=\"post-11404\" class=\"post-11404 post type-post status-publish format-standard has-post-thumbnail hentry category-carousel-content category-featurednews category-features category-home category-news tag-abzu tag-animal-crossing tag-calming-games tag-everybodys-gone-to-the-rapture tag-everything tag-indie-games tag-journey tag-relaxing tag-relaxing-games tag-stardew-valley tag-thatgamecompany\"><div class=\"entry-wrap\"><div class=\"x-recent-posts-img\" style=\"background-image: url(https://news.game.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/journey-1184x662.png);\"></div><div class=\"x-recent-posts-content\"><h3 class=\"h-recent-posts\">6 relaxing games to help you chill out</h3><span class=\"x-recent-posts-date\">17th October 2019</span></div></div></article></a></div></div><div  class=\"x-column x-sm cs-ta-center x-1-3\" style=\"padding: 0px;\" ><div  class=\"x-text\"    ><p><a href=\"https://www.game.co.uk/en/games/watch-dogs/watch-dogs-legion/?cm_sp=GAMEMedia-_-WatchDogsLegionInterview-_-WDL\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><em><strong>Get ready to save London by pre-ordering Watch Dogs Legion here</strong></em></a></p>\n</div><a  class=\"x-btn x-btn-transparent x-btn-global\" style=\"background-color: #ff8c00;border-color: #ff8c00;\" href=\"https://www.game.co.uk/en/games/watch-dogs/watch-dogs-legion/?cm_sp=GAMEMedia-_-WatchDogsLegionInterview-_-WDL\" title=\"https://www.game.co.uk/en/games/watch-dogs/watch-dogs-legion/?cm_sp=GAMEMedia-_-WatchDogsLegionInterview-_-WDL\" target=\"_blank\"   data-options=\"thumbnail: ''\">Pre-order Watch Dogs Legion at GAME today</a></div></div></div></div>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://news.game.co.uk/watch-dogs-legion-london-interview/\">How on-the-ground research shaped Watch Dogs Legion’s version of London</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://news.game.co.uk\">GAME | Media</a>.</p>\n",

If you&#8217;re familiar at all with any of Obsidian&#8217;s other titles, it&#8217;s going to put the same heavy emphasis on choice and consequence, on having a lot of options as to how you play and how the story unfolds. There are a lot of really cool characters and it&#8217;s a very unique setting. You&#8217;re going to meet a lot of people you wouldn&#8217;t be able to meet in the real world, because it&#8217;s a very different environment. It&#8217;s set in outer space on a colony on the edge of space, it&#8217;s the furthest one from Earth, and you’re utterly alone. So what happens there, stays there. And they have to solve their own problems.</p>\n<p><strong>GAME</strong>: One of the interesting things about The Outer Worlds is that everything is run by corporations, how did that idea come about?</p>\n<p><strong>Dan McPhee</strong>: Tim [Cain] and Leonard [Boyarsky] wanted to explore a setting that was unique from other sci-fi settings that they&#8217;d seen before. And one idea was to take an alternate look at our history with corporations were back in the early 1900s, when the trust funds were busted up and the big banks busted. And we kind of saw a fight back against heavy conglomerates and monopolies [at the time]. </p>\n<p>They said, ‘Well, what if that didn&#8217;t happen?’ The more they thought about that, and the more we kind of experimented with the different types of stories you can tell in that setting, the more compelling we found it. So they said, ’What if a corporation bought a space colony and everything there is run by this set of 10 super corporations that own many different sub-corporations, kind of like how we have in the real world.</p>\n</div><img  class=\"x-img x-img-none\"  src=\"https://news.game.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/tow-byzantium-cityscape-screenshot.jpg\" alt=\"The Outer Worlds RPG\"><div  class=\"x-text\"    ><p><strong>GAME</strong>: One of the really cool things about the game, is the narrative choices you can make, the way you interact with characters, and how that can lead you down different paths. How do you approach making that all make sense in the game?</p>\n<p><strong>Dan McPhee:</strong> We start with a basic idea of what are the things that we want the player to be able to do? Say it&#8217;s a conversation. So what dialogue options do we want? We might start with the option where you&#8217;re nice to the guy, then here&#8217;s the one where your mean, here&#8217;s the sort of neutral one. And then from there, we kind of branch out into what are some options that are specific to this situation. Like, is this guy being a jerk? Maybe your responses are based off that, or we talked to other people who are play testing it around the office and we say, ‘Hey, was there anything you wanted to say here?’ Or they come to us and demand us to put in an option that they really wanted! </p>\n<p>And then for things like quests, like when we put in different options for different play styles, a lot of it comes back to gameplay. What is the stealth player’s option? What is the combat player’s option? We want to make sure that no matter how you&#8217;re playing the game, we provide enough avenues for those styles to be compelling and fun. So a lot of that starts with those core things. And then we sort of branch out and we pepper in little things that you wouldn&#8217;t expect. Just some fun stuff for humour sometimes. We just swing for the fences with some of that stuff.</p>\n<p><strong>GAME</strong>: Have you put something in the game knowing that it will almost likely be never seen by someone?</p>\n<p><strong>Dan McPhee</strong>: I love that stuff. I love the little details like that. Yeah, [in The Outer Worlds], there&#8217;s one town where there&#8217;s a little group of people just drinking around a little fire. And I put in some interactions where if you steal their drinks, they&#8217;ll yell at you about it. No one&#8217;s ever going to do that. But the few people who do I think will find it really funny. I like that stuff. So I kind of try and pepper it in wherever I can.</p>\n</div><img  class=\"x-img x-img-none\"  src=\"https://news.game.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/tow-roseway-dialogue-screenshot.jpg\" ><div  class=\"x-text\"    ><p><strong>GAME</strong>: Ha, that’s amazing! Now, Obsidian have a really rich history when it comes to role playing games. What sort of lessons you taken from those games and are bringing into The Outer Worlds? </p>\n<p><strong>Dan McPhee</strong>: We&#8217;re building on foundations that come from that core desire to give the player a way to tell their own story. For example, the player character is just dropped into this colony and you’re woken up on a colony ship. You can choose what you did in a past life. But it doesn&#8217;t have a huge ramification, you&#8217;re kind of like a blank slate. And that&#8217;s kind of one lesson that we learned from games where the more we try to define about the player character, the less you get to define. </p>\n<p>So instead, we made the setting where this person is the only one with the freedom to do what they want. And that has allowed us to just provide all these different avenues for people to [get] the kind of story that they want. It&#8217;s less restricted than past games have been, as our games have been like, here&#8217;s the core story, you&#8217;re going to follow it no matter what, but there are some kind of side options to do. [For The Outer Worlds] we put much less emphasis on that core and more emphasis on the side stuff on the decisions you make while you&#8217;re following that.</p>\n<p><strong>GAME</strong>: In the gameplay demo, we saw the two companions who are in the game. How do they work and who is your favourite companion?</p>\n<p><strong>Dan McPhee</strong>: Okay, so for the first question, how they work is they automatically assist you in combat, you can kind of direct them if you want to. And you also have options to spend skills and stats to make them better instead of yourself. We have a number of players at the office actually who really enjoyed just beefing them up and giving them really powerful equipment so that they don&#8217;t have to do anything. You just sit back and let them wreck. </p>\n<p>For your second question. I am admittedly biased because I wrote one of them. So she’s probably my favourite. I wrote, Nyoka the machine gun woman that you saw in the demo. Yeah, she was really fun.</p>\n</div><img  class=\"x-img x-img-none\"  src=\"https://news.game.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/tow-roseway-combat-screenshot.jpg\" ><div  class=\"x-text\"    ><p><strong>GAME</strong>: Where did the inspiration for her come from?<br />\n<strong></p>\n<p>Dan McPhee</strong>: So she was kind of a fun evolution of ideas. One of the things I like to do is try and imagine a world where gameplay and narrative hold hands and play nice. So when we were designing this monster planet, we were [thinking] what companions are we going to have? Where are we going to put them. And one thing that immediately stood out to me was, we&#8217;ve always wanted to do this combat oriented hunter archetype [and] it makes sense to just put them on this planet, because… you can ask her for help guiding you through the wilderness, and she&#8217;ll know all about the creatures and where to go and what to shoot and what to run from. </p>\n<p>At first we imagined like maybe it would be funny if she were this very prim and proper, kind of like a Nigel Thornberry type. Like she really enjoys taking trophies and stuff. But there was in the back of my mind, there&#8217;s this sort of little bit of a dissonance because this planet is very rough around the edges. People here have been abandoned for a decade, they&#8217;re really struggling to survive. And so to have this person who&#8217;s very crusty, upper class… It could be funny, but it also didn&#8217;t quite jive with the general theme of the planet. So I was thinking about how to rough her up a little bit. </p>\n<p>And then one day, one of our systems designers came into my office and said, ‘Hey, we&#8217;re rebalancing the companion weapons. Would you be cool with us giving her a machine gun instead of the rifle’ that she had at the time? I was like, well, it&#8217;s a little weird. It&#8217;s a little weird for a big game hunter to have a machine gun, but I’ll think about it. And then, for some reason, this very vivid image of this scene from the movie Predator popped into my head, where they&#8217;re standing in a line just mowing down the jungle. I was like, wow, that could be really funny. If she were more like a mercenary type. Like, she still loves camping and wilderness hiking, and she likes to explore. But she&#8217;s much less about trophy gathering. </p>\n<p>So then I started running with that, and I started working on her backstory. And then I imagined for a person who&#8217;s grown up here, who&#8217;s been living here for so long, what has happened in her past to bring her to this place? And so you can sort of dig into some of the darker parts of her history as part of her companion quest there. You kind of get to discover [aspects of her past] if you spend enough time with her.</p>\n</div><img  class=\"x-img x-img-none\"  src=\"https://news.game.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/tow-monarch-melee-screenshot.jpg\" ><div  class=\"x-text\"    ><p><strong>GAME</strong>: And finally if you could work for any of the corporations in the game, who would it be and why?</p>\n<p><strong>Dan McPhee</strong>: Hmm, probably Rizzo’s. You see a sign for Rizzo’s in the trailer and they’re the purveyors of wines, alcohols, and candies. So they might be pretty fun. They also had the most colourful scheme for their branding. I saw a lot of like purples and blues and stuff. They just seem like they&#8217;d be fun. If any of the corporations could be said to be fun, maybe it would be them!</p>\n</div><div  class=\"x-text\"    ><p><em>And if you want the latest news, features, and deals from GAME, <a href=\"https://my.game.co.uk/preferences\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">sign up to our newsletter today!</a></em></p>\n</div><div  class=\"x-recent-posts cf horizontal\"  data-x-element=\"recent_posts\" data-x-params=\"{&quot;fade&quot;:false}\" data-fade=\"false\" ><a class=\"x-recent-post2 with-image\" href=\"https://news.game.co.uk/death-stranding-everything-you-need-to-know/\" title=\"Permalink to: &quot;Everything you need to know about Death Stranding&quot;\"><article id=\"post-11421\" class=\"post-11421 post type-post status-publish format-standard has-post-thumbnail hentry category-carousel-content category-featurednews category-features category-home category-news tag-death-stranding tag-everything tag-everything-you-need-to-know tag-guide tag-hideo-kojima tag-playstation-4 tag-ps4\"><div class=\"entry-wrap\"><div class=\"x-recent-posts-img\" style=\"background-image: url(https://news.game.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/death-stranding-everything-we-know-cargo-1184x662.jpg);\"></div><div class=\"x-recent-posts-content\"><h3 class=\"h-recent-posts\">Everything you need to know about Death Stranding</h3><span class=\"x-recent-posts-date\">18th October 2019</span></div></div></article></a><a class=\"x-recent-post2 with-image\" href=\"https://news.game.co.uk/relaxing-games/\" title=\"Permalink to: &quot;6 relaxing games to help you chill out&quot;\"><article id=\"post-11404\" class=\"post-11404 post type-post status-publish format-standard has-post-thumbnail hentry category-carousel-content category-featurednews category-features category-home category-news tag-abzu tag-animal-crossing tag-calming-games tag-everybodys-gone-to-the-rapture tag-everything tag-indie-games tag-journey tag-relaxing tag-relaxing-games tag-stardew-valley tag-thatgamecompany\"><div class=\"entry-wrap\"><div class=\"x-recent-posts-img\" style=\"background-image: url(https://news.game.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/journey-1184x662.png);\"></div><div class=\"x-recent-posts-content\"><h3 class=\"h-recent-posts\">6 relaxing games to help you chill out</h3><span class=\"x-recent-posts-date\">17th October 2019</span></div></div></article></a></div></div><div  class=\"x-column x-sm cs-ta-center x-1-3\" style=\"padding: 0px;\" ><div  class=\"x-text\"    ><p><a href=\"https://www.game.co.uk/en/games/the-outer-worlds/?cm_sp=GAMEMedia-_-TheOuterWorldsInterview-_-TheOuterWorlds\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><em><strong>The Outer Worlds is blasting onto PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC on 25 October</strong></em></a></p>\n</div><a  class=\"x-btn x-btn-transparent x-btn-global\" style=\"background-color: #ff8c00;border-color: #ff8c00;\" href=\"https://www.game.co.uk/en/games/the-outer-worlds/?cm_sp=GAMEMedia-_-TheOuterWorldsInterview-_-TheOuterWorlds\" title=\"https://www.game.co.uk/en/games/the-outer-worlds/?cm_sp=GAMEMedia-_-TheOuterWorldsInterview-_-TheOuterWorlds\" target=\"_blank\"   data-options=\"thumbnail: ''\">Pre-order The Outer Worlds at GAME here</a></div></div></div></div>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://news.game.co.uk/the-outer-world-interview/\">How The Outer Worlds builds on Obsidian’s brilliant heritage</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://news.game.co.uk\">GAME | Media</a>.</p>\n",

Cinematic influence</span></h2><img  class=\"x-img x-img-none\"  src=\"https://news.game.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/MUA-3-The-Black-Order.jpg\" ><div  class=\"x-text\"    ><p> Let’s start with the story. While the first two Marvel Ultimate Alliance games focused on the comic side of things, with the second MUA game adapting the iconic Civil War storyline, this one focuses more on the MCU. Characters and designs take their inspiration from their big-screen counterparts, with the Guardians making their Ultimate Alliance debut. </p>\n<p>Because Ultimate Alliance lets you choose a squad of 4 heroes to from your roster, you’ll be able to create the sort of team ups that you could only dream about… Okay, until Endgame gave us all the team ups, but still.</p>\n</div><h2  class=\"h-custom-headline h3\" ><span>2. Taking on Thanos<br />\n</span></h2><div  class=\"x-text\"    ><p>Speaking of cinematic influence, the story from Marc Sumerak, will also feature Thanos and The Black Order. Hey, they’re in the title of the game for a reason after all. While we might have just seen the MCU’s version of this story wrap-up, it’ll mark the first time Thanos has appeared in a Marvel Ultimate Alliance game, meaning the stakes have never been higher for this universe.</p>\n</div><h2  class=\"h-custom-headline h3\" ><span>3. New developers</span></h2><img  class=\"x-img x-img-none\"  src=\"https://news.game.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/MUA-3-fight.jpg\" ><div  class=\"x-text\"    ><p>It’s not just a new storyline to be excited for with MUA 3, it’s also got veteran action developers Team Ninja working on it. They’re known for working on the legendary (hard) Ninja Gaiden series, as well as Nioh, Hyrule Warriors, and plenty of other games. When it comes to having a scrap in a video game, they know how to deliver, and we can’t wait to see what they do when they have a talking Raccoon and a sentient tree to play with. </p>\n<p>The combat will still be familiar to fans of the series though, with light attacks, special abilities, and the ultimate attacks that look like a comic pane come to life. You’ll also be able to upgrade characters in your roster collectively and individually, giving you a deep role playing experience alongside the frantic combat we know Team Ninja can deliver.</p>\n</div><h2  class=\"h-custom-headline h3\" ><span>4. New Camera </span></h2><div  class=\"x-text\"    ><p>While the series is known for being played in a top-down perspective, Marvel Ultimate Alliance 3 will also introduce a new ‘Hero Camera’. This puts the camera closer to the action, like in a more traditional action game, giving you a new perspective on all the moves your heroes are pulling off. The isometric camera remains, but this looks like a fun way of adding  more style to the game’s combat.</p>\n</div><h2  class=\"h-custom-headline h3\" ><span>5.

For instance, we spy a living statue (he’s called Martin Chandra) and discover he makes money selling photos of his biceps online. A peculiar way to make some cash, but he does have a handy ability that gives him a 10% increase to melee damage, so we save him to our contacts with a tap of the right bumper.</p>\n</div><a  class=\"x-img x-img-link x-img-none\"  href=\"https://www.game.co.uk/en/games/watch-dogs/watch-dogs-legion/?cm_sp=GAMEMedia-_-WDLPrev-_-WDL\" title=\"https://www.game.co.uk/en/games/watch-dogs/watch-dogs-legion/?cm_sp=GAMEMedia-_-WDLPrev-_-WDL\" target=\"_blank\"   data-options=\"thumbnail: 'https://news.game.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Watch-Dogs-Legion-Recruitment.jpg'\"><img src=\"https://news.game.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Watch-Dogs-Legion-Recruitment.jpg\" alt=\"Watch Dogs Legion preview\"></a><div  class=\"x-text\"    ><p>This is the first step of recruiting London’s many citizens. Once they are in your contacts list, it’ll show you their opinion of DedSec, potential ways you can influence said opinion, and most importantly, their daily routine. We now know when Martin starts and finishes his living statue gig, when he heads home, and any stops he makes in-between. To take control of Martin, we’ll need to sway his opinion of DedSec and then complete a recruitment mission for him. The fact you can do this for every single character in the game makes the scope of this system staggering in its ambition.  </p>\n<p>However, we decide that Martin might not be an ideal recruit&#8230; Mainly because gold living statues aren’t known for being that inconspicuous, so we decide to explore London a little more to find a Londoner who might fit the bill more.</p>\n</div><h2  class=\"h-custom-headline h3\" ><span>London Calling</span></h2><div  class=\"x-text\"    ><p>England’s capital is still a novel setting to see in a game, which is why we’re keen to keep having a look around. Despite being set in the near-future, it’s still a recognisable London, from the hustle and bustle of the people you see, to notable landmarks such as the Houses of Parliament in Westminster. Not that we’re here to sightsee, as we spy another person who we want to recruit: Sarah Beck. </p>\n<p>She’s a lawyer who currently opposes DedSec, which means we’ve got our work cut out to get her onside. Fortunately for us, she’s also got a cousin who’s being blackmailed, giving us a chance to change her opinion of our hacking gang. That’s because helping out family members of the people you want to recruit in Watch Dogs Legion means they’ll spread positive messages about DedSec, influencing people in their immediate family.</p>\n</div><a  class=\"x-img x-img-link x-img-none\"  href=\"https://www.game.co.uk/en/games/watch-dogs/watch-dogs-legion/?cm_sp=GAMEMedia-_-WDLPrev-_-WDL\" title=\"https://www.game.co.uk/en/games/watch-dogs/watch-dogs-legion/?cm_sp=GAMEMedia-_-WDLPrev-_-WDL\" target=\"_blank\"   data-options=\"thumbnail: 'https://news.game.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Watch-Dogs-Legion-Helen-Zapping.jpg'\"><img src=\"https://news.game.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Watch-Dogs-Legion-Helen-Zapping.jpg\" alt=\"Watch Dogs Legion\"></a><div  class=\"x-text\"    ><p>With a way of changing Sarah’s opinion in place, we now shuffle to the nearest car and pinpoint where and when Sarah’s cousin is meeting their blackmailer, speeding off to their rendezvous. We arrive to see Sarah’s cousin anxiously remonstrating with his blackmailer, and knowing that he’s a wrong ‘un, we go up behind him and gleefully watch the eldery Britannia taser the villain until he’s unconscious. </p>\n<p>This quickly turns out to be a poorly thought out plan. </p>\n</div><h2  class=\"h-custom-headline h3\" ><span>Bobbies on the beat</span></h2><div  class=\"x-text\"    ><p>The reason we say that is because two officers spot us and move in to arrest Britannia. Because our current character is slow (some would say experienced), we won’t be able to outrun them on foot. Instead, we decide to try and foolishly fight the police who approach us. One smack to an officer is enough for the pair to draw their pistols and start firing. While 50% of the game’s weapons aren’t lethal, we’ve escalated this encounter enough to ensure the police won’t be taking Britannia as a prisoner. And, because the game supports permadeath, we also run the risk of losing her for good. It adds a thick layer of tension to this suddenly deadly fight.  </p>\n<p>Fortunately, we can even the odds with a machine gun that shoots non-lethal shock rounds, buying ourselves enough time to hightail to a nearby car and flee the scene. While outright violence is never as ingeniously satisfying as turning the game’s electronic devices against their owners in Watch Dogs, we would be lying if we said we didn’t find immobilising the two guards who had almost killed Britannia to be cathartic. </p>\n<p>Anyway, we’re not quite safe yet, as riot drones chase the car we’re in and pelt it with bullets. We continue to fling it through Westminster, managing to escape by skidding through side roads and staying out of sight long enough for the police to give up hunt. It’s only at the end of this thrilling escapade that we realise we’ve ended up at New Scotland Yard, the police station where Sarah Beck is currently working.</p>\n</div><a  class=\"x-img x-img-link x-img-none\"  href=\"https://www.game.co.uk/en/games/watch-dogs/watch-dogs-legion/?cm_sp=GAMEMedia-_-WDLPrev-_-WDL\" title=\"https://www.game.co.uk/en/games/watch-dogs/watch-dogs-legion/?cm_sp=GAMEMedia-_-WDLPrev-_-WDL\" target=\"_blank\"   data-options=\"thumbnail: 'https://news.game.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Watch-Dogs-Legion-Getaway.jpg'\"><img src=\"https://news.game.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Watch-Dogs-Legion-Getaway.jpg\" alt=\"Watch Dogs Legion\"></a><div  class=\"x-text\"    ><p>The good news for us? After taking out her cousin’s blackmailer, we’ve improved her opinion of DedSec enough to be able to recruit her to our cause. The bad news? We’re going to have to make face-to-face contact to convince her. And that means we need to find a way to sneak into a police station.</p>\n<p>Like in Watch Dogs 2, you can find items to hack in your immediate vicinity by pushing in the right stick. We do this to hack into the building via a CCTV camera inside, and explore it through the various cameras we can jump between. We quickly discover Sarah working in a locked room, which puts a pause on our plan of strolling in for a chinwag. A guard carries the digital key nearby though, so it’s time to use Britannia’s special gadget, the Spider Bot, which can get in close and hack it for us to use.</p>\n</div><h2  class=\"h-custom-headline h3\" ><span>Spider-Bot Surprise</span></h2><div  class=\"x-text\"    ><p>Taking remote control of the Spider-Bot, we scuttle through the front door and hop over the airport security style bag scanner that sits in the waiting room of New Scotland Yard, giving us access to normally off-limit areas. We then use the bot to get close to the guard who has the key to Sarah’s door and download it from them. And then, just as we’re about to find a way to sneak into New Scotland Yard as Britannia, Sarah gets up, and walks out of the building, as it’s her lunch break. Because every character has a schedule, you can plan when’s the best time to approach them. It turns out our planned attempt to meet her in her work place is just as valid as waiting for her schedule to move forward. </p>\n<p>We don’t waste any time by making contact with her, and Sarah tells us we can help her by deleting incriminating footage that Albion (the private military company who are the dystopian overlords you’re fighting against in <a href=\"https://www.game.co.uk/en/games/watch-dogs/watch-dogs-legion/?cm_sp=GAMEMedia-_-WDLPrev-_-WDL\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Watch Dogs Legion</a>) are using against her. She asks us  to erase the footage of this that’s incredibly located in the building we just spent five minutes trying to get into: New Scotland Yard. We love it when a plan comes together. </p>\n<p>Now we know the layout of the building, and have the key to the server room, we use our friendly spider bot to head back into New Scotland Yard. It crawls through a few vents before sneaking up to the room where the video is on. With our robo-crawler in position to erase the data, we need to get Britannia in-range to initiate the process as well. Fortunately, the radius we need to be in is large enough that we can hang outside the front of New Scotland Yard without alerting any suspicions.  </p>\n</div><a  class=\"x-img x-img-link x-img-none\"  href=\"https://www.game.co.uk/en/games/watch-dogs/watch-dogs-legion/?cm_sp=GAMEMedia-_-WDLPrev-_-WDL\" title=\"https://www.game.co.uk/en/games/watch-dogs/watch-dogs-legion/?cm_sp=GAMEMedia-_-WDLPrev-_-WDL\" target=\"_blank\"   data-options=\"thumbnail: 'https://news.game.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Watch-Dogs-Legion-Spider-Bot.jpg'\"><img src=\"https://news.game.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Watch-Dogs-Legion-Spider-Bot.jpg\" alt=\"Watch Dogs Legion\"></a><div  class=\"x-text\"    ><p>With the footage deleted, Sarah is now officially part of DedSec and that means we can now play as her. At this point, we get the chance to assign her to one of the three classes any character can be. Sarah has a +10 turret damage buff, which would work well with the Hacker class’s Spider-Bots turret. Not that we have to assign her as a Hacker. We could choose to turn her into an infiltrator, which gives her an AR cloak that would make Sarah practically invisible for a few seconds. We can already tell the intricacies of finding the right people for your crew is going to be part of Watch Dogs Legion’s open-ended fun. </p>\n<p>And with that, our demo comes to a close. It’s a brief but electrifying glimpse at the potential Watch Dogs Legion’s ambitious premise possess. From the freedom of picking anyone off the street to draft into your hacking supergroup, to the emergent potential we see in how the recruitment process takes place, it feels like several steps ahead of what we could have conceivably expected a Watch Dogs sequel to look like.

The game will feature several planets that the player can elect to travel to via starship.  On these worlds unique abilities and upgrades can be found that open up new paths across other planets, making retraversal an essential part of the gameplay experience.&#8221;  </p>\n<p>Asmussen also explains why they’ve released this new footage after E3. “We spent months going back and forth discussing the best strategy to release this content, and ultimately decided for the first-look, it was critical to present a focused 15 minutes of raw, in-game footage highlighting lightsaber gameplay that speaks to the Jedi fantasy in an empowering way.” </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.game.co.uk/en/games/star-wars/jedi-fallen-order/?cm_sp=GAMEMedia-_-StarWarsDemo-_-JediFallenOrder\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order</a> was one of our favourite games from this year’s show, promising a story-driven Star Wars adventure that will help fill in a period of Star Wars history that still remains quite mysterious. Expect a disturbance in the Force when this launches on 15 November.</p>\n</div><div  class=\"x-text\"    ><p><em>And if you want the latest news, features, and deals from GAME, <a href=\"https://my.game.co.uk/preferences\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">sign up to our newsletter today!</a></em></p>\n</div><div  class=\"x-recent-posts cf horizontal\"  data-x-element=\"recent_posts\" data-x-params=\"{&quot;fade&quot;:false}\" data-fade=\"false\" ><a class=\"x-recent-post2 with-image\" href=\"https://news.game.co.uk/death-stranding-everything-you-need-to-know/\" title=\"Permalink to: &quot;Everything you need to know about Death Stranding&quot;\"><article id=\"post-11421\" class=\"post-11421 post type-post status-publish format-standard has-post-thumbnail hentry category-carousel-content category-featurednews category-features category-home category-news tag-death-stranding tag-everything tag-everything-you-need-to-know tag-guide tag-hideo-kojima tag-playstation-4 tag-ps4\"><div class=\"entry-wrap\"><div class=\"x-recent-posts-img\" style=\"background-image: url(https://news.game.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/death-stranding-everything-we-know-cargo-1184x662.jpg);\"></div><div class=\"x-recent-posts-content\"><h3 class=\"h-recent-posts\">Everything you need to know about Death Stranding</h3><span class=\"x-recent-posts-date\">18th October 2019</span></div></div></article></a><a class=\"x-recent-post2 with-image\" href=\"https://news.game.co.uk/relaxing-games/\" title=\"Permalink to: &quot;6 relaxing games to help you chill out&quot;\"><article id=\"post-11404\" class=\"post-11404 post type-post status-publish format-standard has-post-thumbnail hentry category-carousel-content category-featurednews category-features category-home category-news tag-abzu tag-animal-crossing tag-calming-games tag-everybodys-gone-to-the-rapture tag-everything tag-indie-games tag-journey tag-relaxing tag-relaxing-games tag-stardew-valley tag-thatgamecompany\"><div class=\"entry-wrap\"><div class=\"x-recent-posts-img\" style=\"background-image: url(https://news.game.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/journey-1184x662.png);\"></div><div class=\"x-recent-posts-content\"><h3 class=\"h-recent-posts\">6 relaxing games to help you chill out</h3><span class=\"x-recent-posts-date\">17th October 2019</span></div></div></article></a></div></div><div  class=\"x-column x-sm cs-ta-center x-1-3\" style=\"padding: 0px;\" ><div  class=\"x-text\"    ><p><strong><a href=\"https://www.game.co.uk/en/games/star-wars/jedi-fallen-order/?cm_sp=GAMEMedia-_-StarWarsDemo-_-JediFallenOrder\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Fight to survive Order 66 in Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order by pre-ordering at GAME today.</a></strong><em></p>\n</div><a  class=\"x-btn x-btn-transparent x-btn-global\" style=\"background-color: #ff8c00;border-color: #ff8c00;\" href=\"https://www.game.co.uk/en/games/star-wars/jedi-fallen-order/?cm_sp=GAMEMedia-_-StarWarsDemo-_-JediFallenOrder\" title=\"https://www.game.co.uk/en/games/star-wars/jedi-fallen-order/?cm_sp=GAMEMedia-_-StarWarsDemo-_-JediFallenOrder\" target=\"_blank\"   data-options=\"thumbnail: ''\">Pre-order Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order here</a></div></div></div></div>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://news.game.co.uk/star-wars-jedi-fallen-order-demo/\">This extended Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order demo shows more of the galactic adventure</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://news.game.co.uk\">GAME | Media</a>.</p>\n",

To make it as fair as possible, we held a tournament over on Twitter so you could narrow down the list of some of the biggest games that made an appearance at E3, from sixteen contenders down to just one. </p>\n</div><img  class=\"x-img x-img-none\"  src=\"https://news.game.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/fan-favourite-game-e3-2019-lineup.png\" alt=\"fan favourite game e3 2019 lineup\"><div  class=\"x-text\"    ><p>The battle was heated, and one by one, the various options were gradually whittled down, until at last we had our final four. And after a nail-biting final round, Cyberpunk 2077 was left at the top of the pile.</p>\n<p>The other final three in the running were the ghostly <a href=\"https://www.game.co.uk/en/luigis-mansion-3-2504613?cm_sp=GAMEMedia-_-FanFavouriteE3Game-_-LuigisMansion3\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Luigi’s Mansion 3</a>, hacking-themed action adventure <a href=\"https://www.game.co.uk/en/games/watch-dogs/watch-dogs-legion/?cm_sp=GAMEMedia-_-FanFavouriteE3Game-_-WatchDogsLegion\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Watch Dogs Legion</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.game.co.uk/en/the-legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild-2-2388619?cm_sp=GAMEMedia-_-FanFavouriteE3Game-_-ZeldaBOTWSequel\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">the sequel</a> to open world adventure <a href=\"https://www.game.co.uk/en/games/breath-of-the-wild/?cm_sp=GAMEMedia-_-FanFavouriteE3Game-_-ZeldaBOTW\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</a>, all of which were worthy contenders for the top spot. (Actually, we’d have been happy for any of them to come top, but that’s beside the point). </p>\n<p>If you’ve not heard of Cyberpunk 2077 already, it’s a dark and dystopian sci-fi adventure set in a futuristic world in which flying cars and cybernetic body modifications are commonplace. You play as V, a mercenary-for-hire who is hot on the trail of the ultimate cybernetic enhancement, which has the power to grant immortality. </p>\n<p>The upcoming game is the latest project from CD Projekt Red (who you may know as the developers of <a href=\"https://www.game.co.uk/en/games/the-witcher-3-wild-hunt/the-witcher-3-goty/?cm_sp=GAMEMedia-_-FanFavouriteE3Game-_-TheWitcher3\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">The Witcher</a> games) and it’s looking very different so far to their famous fantasy series. The reveal at E3 that the inimitable <a href=\"https://news.game.co.uk/e3-2019-cyberpunk-2077-keanu-reeves/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Keanu Reeves will be appearing in the game</a> also took the world by storm. </p>\n<p>And judging from the reactions to our Twitter polls and the final result, Cyberpunk 2077’s success was very well deserved indeed. Congratulations again to CD Projekt Red and Bandai Namco!</p>\n</div><div  class=\"x-text\"    ><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-conversation=\"none\" data-lang=\"en\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://twitter.com/CyberpunkGame?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@CyberpunkGame</a>  should definitely win this!</p>\n<p>&mdash; CJ Nokes (@CJNokes) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/CJNokes/status/1141721511113482241?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">June 20, 2019</a></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><script async src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script></p>\n</div><div  class=\"x-text\"    ><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-conversation=\"none\" data-lang=\"en\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">That&#39;s such a difficult choice as those are my two favourites!

A gleeful, exuberant game and that just dovetails with LEGO, which is also gleeful and exuberant… </p>\n<p>“The experience that we have here today is the first five minutes of the game, that introduces you to the world and it unleashes this chaotic, beautiful wilderness of LEGO bricks, alien ships, dinosaur dig sites, pirates, and so many other things that flow so naturally the moment you take the brakes off.”</p>\n<p>Those opening five minutes also give you a chance to sample some of the new LEGO cars you can drive in the game, which includes the Mini Rally S and the Ferrari F40 Competizione. Ellert explains what considerations the team had to take when creating this magic mash-up. “The key thing was that we were working with LEGO, specifically in the brand, Speed Champions. </p>\n<p>&#8220;That meant there were very specific cars we were going to use, and that meant for the launch version of the expansion that is the LEGO version of the McLaren Senna, of the F40 Competizione, and the iconic Mini Rally S and those are given, those are designed, they look the way they look.”</p>\n</div><a  class=\"x-img x-img-link x-img-none\"  href=\"https://www.game.co.uk/en/games/forza-horizon/forza-horizon-4/?cm_sp=GAMEMedia-_-ForzaLegoArticle-_-FH4\" title=\"https://www.game.co.uk/en/games/forza-horizon/forza-horizon-4/?cm_sp=GAMEMedia-_-ForzaLegoArticle-_-FH4\"    data-options=\"thumbnail: 'https://news.game.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/LEGO-Forza-Mini-Rally-s.jpg'\"><img src=\"https://news.game.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/LEGO-Forza-Mini-Rally-s.jpg\" alt=\"Lego forza\"></a><div  class=\"x-text\"    ><p>Ellert reveals to us that the team used the <a href=\"https://www.lego.com/en-us/ldd\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">LEGO Digital Designer</a> (which you can download for yourself here) to help design the world. He says “So, for example, the world map is made of LEGO, it&#8217;s a LEGO diorama. I love it, if you actually built it, it would be about 20 ft long, and about 75,000 individual LEGO bricks make up the world map.” </p>\n<p>Because the Digital Designer lets you buy the LEGO models you create in it, the team investigated if they could order a real version of the LEGO Valley area you explore in the game, but sadly, it was a bit too expensive or as Ellert puts it: “People worked out what our LEGO map would cost and there was a sudden, shocking silence and all plans to make it went away!”  </p>\n<p>One of the key things that gives <a href=\"https://www.game.co.uk/en/games/forza-horizon/forza-horizon-4/?cm_sp=GAMEMedia-_-ForzaLegoArticle-_-FH4\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Forza Horizon 4’s LEGO Speed Champions</a> its charm is how the open world you race through takes loads of different styles and racing types and blends them effortlessly together. As Ellert elaborates “It was really about identifying the kind of experiences we wanted and then dressing them up in LEGO, but there really is something for everyone in the pack I think.</p>\n</div><a  class=\"x-img x-img-link x-img-none\"  href=\"https://www.game.co.uk/en/games/forza-horizon/forza-horizon-4/?cm_sp=GAMEMedia-_-ForzaLegoArticle-_-FH4\" title=\"https://www.game.co.uk/en/games/forza-horizon/forza-horizon-4/?cm_sp=GAMEMedia-_-ForzaLegoArticle-_-FH4\"    data-options=\"thumbnail: 'https://news.game.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/LEGO-Forza-Football.jpg'\"><img src=\"https://news.game.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/LEGO-Forza-Football.jpg\" alt=\"lego forza\"></a><div  class=\"x-text\"    ><p>The result is an expansion that takes Forza Horizon 4’s enjoyably weighty racing and mixes it with a world full of personality thanks to those enduring Danish bricks. The surprise of it appearing at E3 is matched by the joy of actually getting to race around LEGO Valley, exploring the vibrant mix of areas and ploughing through fields of LEGO flowers. It’s a hoot to play, but that’s also because Forza Horizon 4 is an incredible strong foundation to build on. </p>\n<p>Ellert tell us: “My favourite bit is, there&#8217;s a dirt circuit called Ocean View circuit, and it has something quite unusual for us, it has a very steep decline through water and an incline right on the other end, so it&#8217;s a 35 degree incline down and the same up again. While everything else is fantastic, and I could wax lyrical about Brickchester and the alien power cells, the experience of coming down and up on the other side [around Ocean View circuit] was lovely. It has nothing to do with LEGO, it was just a thing that the level designers built and put into the world.” </p>\n</div><div  class=\"x-text\"    ><p><em>And if you want the latest news, features, and deals from GAME, <a href=\"https://my.game.co.uk/preferences\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">sign up to our newsletter today!</a></em></p>\n</div><div  class=\"x-recent-posts cf horizontal\"  data-x-element=\"recent_posts\" data-x-params=\"{&quot;fade&quot;:false}\" data-fade=\"false\" ><a class=\"x-recent-post2 with-image\" href=\"https://news.game.co.uk/death-stranding-everything-you-need-to-know/\" title=\"Permalink to: &quot;Everything you need to know about Death Stranding&quot;\"><article id=\"post-11421\" class=\"post-11421 post type-post status-publish format-standard has-post-thumbnail hentry category-carousel-content category-featurednews category-features category-home category-news tag-death-stranding tag-everything tag-everything-you-need-to-know tag-guide tag-hideo-kojima tag-playstation-4 tag-ps4\"><div class=\"entry-wrap\"><div class=\"x-recent-posts-img\" style=\"background-image: url(https://news.game.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/death-stranding-everything-we-know-cargo-1184x662.jpg);\"></div><div class=\"x-recent-posts-content\"><h3 class=\"h-recent-posts\">Everything you need to know about Death Stranding</h3><span class=\"x-recent-posts-date\">18th October 2019</span></div></div></article></a><a class=\"x-recent-post2 with-image\" href=\"https://news.game.co.uk/relaxing-games/\" title=\"Permalink to: &quot;6 relaxing games to help you chill out&quot;\"><article id=\"post-11404\" class=\"post-11404 post type-post status-publish format-standard has-post-thumbnail hentry category-carousel-content category-featurednews category-features category-home category-news tag-abzu tag-animal-crossing tag-calming-games tag-everybodys-gone-to-the-rapture tag-everything tag-indie-games tag-journey tag-relaxing tag-relaxing-games tag-stardew-valley tag-thatgamecompany\"><div class=\"entry-wrap\"><div class=\"x-recent-posts-img\" style=\"background-image: url(https://news.game.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/journey-1184x662.png);\"></div><div class=\"x-recent-posts-content\"><h3 class=\"h-recent-posts\">6 relaxing games to help you chill out</h3><span class=\"x-recent-posts-date\">17th October 2019</span></div></div></article></a></div></div><div  class=\"x-column x-sm cs-ta-center x-1-3\" style=\"padding: 0px;\" ><div  class=\"x-text\"    ><p><a href=\"https://www.game.co.uk/en/games/forza-horizon/forza-horizon-4/?cm_sp=GAMEMedia-_-ForzaLegoArticle-_-FH4\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Start your thrilling journey into LEGO Valley by grabbing Forza Horizon 4 at GAME today</a></p>\n</div><a  class=\"x-btn x-btn-transparent x-btn-global\" style=\"background-color: #ff8c00;border-color: #ff8c00;\" href=\"https://www.game.co.uk/en/games/forza-horizon/forza-horizon-4/?cm_sp=GAMEMedia-_-ForzaLegoArticle-_-FH4\" title=\"https://www.game.co.uk/en/games/forza-horizon/forza-horizon-4/?cm_sp=GAMEMedia-_-ForzaLegoArticle-_-FH4\" target=\"_blank\"   data-options=\"thumbnail: ''\">Get Forza Horizon 4 at GAME today</a></div></div></div></div>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://news.game.co.uk/forza-horzion-4-lego-speed-champions-expansion/\">How Forza Horzion 4’s LEGO Speed Champions expansion was built (brick-by-brick)</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://news.game.co.uk\">GAME | Media</a>.</p>\n",
