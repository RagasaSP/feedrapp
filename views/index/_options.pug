          td.
            Specifies the order of entries. <br>
            By default there is no ordering happening and the entries are kept in the order of the original RSS feed. <br>
            The order can be overridden by providing any of the entry's fields (e.g. publishedDate, title, â€¦). 
            In order to reverse the order, just prefix the field with a <code>-</code>.
